How do you see yourself?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>23</sup><span value="23">And John said, quoting the prophet Isaiah, “I am the voice crying out in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>24</sup><span value="24">Those who had been sent were Pharisees;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>25</sup><span value="25">so they put a further question to John: “Then why are you baptizing if you are not the Messiah, or Elijah, or the Prophet?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>26</sup><span value="26">John answered, “I baptize you with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>27</sup><span value="27">although he comes after me, I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal.”</span></p>
<p><sup>28</sup><span value="28">This happened in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span></p>

<p><sup>32</sup><span value="32">And John also gave this testimony, “I saw the Spirit coming down on him like a dove from heaven and resting on him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>33</sup><span value="33">I myself did not know him but God who sent me to baptize told me: ‘You will see the Spirit coming down and resting on the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>34</sup><span value="34">Yes, I have seen! and I declare that this is the Chosen One of God.”</span></p>

<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Jn 1,1 In the beginning was the Word. The real beginning is not the creation of the universe. For this beginning of time, space, matter, existence explains nothing yet demands an explanation. The real beginning is beyond time. John does not say that at this beginning God was because we know it. He speaks of the Word. We keep this traditional term word, although the term word that John uses says more than word. It is both thought and word, that is the word expressing what one carries in oneself. We ought perhaps translate with: The Expression of the Father, or to speak of his Son, is the same thing. In other pages he will be called Splendor (Heb 1:1) and Image (Col 1:15) of the Father. The Son is not part of the Father, or another God since he has nothing which is of himself but all which is the Father's is also his (Jn 16:15). John will remind us that no one has seen God (v. 18). The Father from whom existence comes and all that exits is without beginning and his springing forth is known only to himself. John tell us here that for him, being, is communicating himself, expressing himself, giving himself. God expresses himself in him who is at the same time his Word and his son and through this uncreated, unique Word, which fully expresses him, he creates a universe which is yet another way of saying what is in God. This is still not enough to satisfy the need of God to communicate himself. As several texts of the Old Testament have already said (Pro 8:22 and 31, 2 S 7:2-30), God has entered through his Word into the history of humanking. It was he who was spoken of in their own way by all who carried the Word, all the prophets of the Bible and those of other religions as well. The Word enlightened all human beigns, including those who did not know God; he was the conscience of the upright in every race, in every age. This Word, Son and expression of the Father came one day to give us the definitive word by means of his own existence in becoming human among us. Whatever has come to be, found life in him (v.4). It is a property of life to develop from within until maturity reached. This growth is to be seen throught history in all the work of the Word; it is the language of God which develops among humankind. Whether we study the history of our race from its origins, or wheter we read the Old Testament, we see how the language of God has been developed among humans. It always was a human language, but this language was inhabiated by the Spirit of God, and in a special way within the history of Israel, it was also the word of God. We shall find this living word in him who is the son-made-human, Jesus, but in a way which disconcerts us. For there is the mystery about the Son: it is true that he is God like the Father, but having received all, he is in a posture of offering: he empties himself so that the Father may exalt and glorify him anew. A man came, sent by God. Twice in verses 6-8 and 25, John, the author of the Gospel, speaks to us of John the Baptist, precursor of Jesus. The Word has truly identified himself: he has not come with glory; he was introduced by a word which came from himself, but remained human in John's preaching. It was easy to reject this witness and in fact when he came to his own, to the people of Israel, his own did not receive him. The Word was made flesh. John uses the word flesh to underline the utter humility of God who, despite being spirit, became a creature with a mortal body. John says: was made, and not: took the apprearance of a human person, because the Son of God was truly human. God become human dwelt among us. The root sense of this verb dwell in the Bible is: to have one's tent pitched. So John is pleased to allude to the sacred tent that seerved as the Hebrews' sanctuary in the desert: in that tent, God was present beside them (Ex 33:7-11). In reality Jesus, the Son of God become human, is the true Temple of God among people (Jn 2:21), a temple as humble and apparently fragile as the tent in the desert was: nevertheless, in him is the fullness of God. The apostles saw his glory at certain moments of his mortal life (Jn 2:11 and Lk 9:32). The saw his glory in his Passion and Resurrection. How does the Word save us? John does not speak only of Jesus rescuing us from the abyss of sin; he prefers to speak of Jesus allowing us to attain a status totally unexpected and beyond our reach: he made them children of God. We are mae children of God by the very son of the Father, provided tthat we believe in his Name, that is in his divine personality. In him was the fullness of Love and Truth (v. 14). Love (or Grace) and Truth (or Faithfulness) are God's two main qualities (Ex 34:6-7). These words are repeated as a refrain throughout Psalm 89. John, means then that he has recognized the fullness of Jesus' divinity (Col 2:29). God has given us the Law. While recounting the sins of Israel, the biblical story foretold the time when theres would be no need for a Law engraved in stones or written in books (Jer 31:31). Some day God would change the sinners' hearts (Ezk 36:26) son that relationships of mutual Love and Faithfulness between God and humankind would begin (Hos 2:21-22). John affirms that the promised time of Love and Truth (of perfect religion) arrived through Jesus Christ. Jn 1,19 THE LAMB The authorities wondered: Who is this who on his own initiative has begun to preach? At that time, varius Jewish groups baztized, or bathed, as a means of purification and to hasten the coming of the Messiah. Regarding John the Baptist's preaching and baptism, see Luke 3:10. The Messiah is the name the Jews gave to the expected Savior. They also expected the Prophet, but it was not clear whether or not the Prophet would be someone other than the Messiah. It was believed that the prophet Elijah would reappear before the Messiah's arrival (Mk 9:11). There is the Lamb (v. 29). In the language of the Jews, the word Lamb can mean both servant and lamb. Jesus is the Servant of God spoken of by the prophets, who was to sacrifice himself for his brothers and sisters. He is also the true Lamb that replaces the Paschal Lamb (Mk 14:12). A man comes after me (v. 30). In history, Jesus appears after John, but being the Word of God, he existed before all creatures. He also precedes, that is to say, all - including John the Baptist - are guided by his light. Jn 1,35 DISCOVERING JESUS This gospel is the work of John the Evangelist who should not be confused with John the Baptist. John the evangelist was one of the first two disciples to follow Jesus (vv. 39). John, concerned about helping us understand the profound meaning of Jesus' actions, dwells pay attention. For example, the Bible begins with the poem describing Creation as happening in seven ddays, and because John sees Jesus' work as a new creation, he describes the beginning of Jesus' public ministry as happening within a week (seven being a symbolic number) (v. 29 35, 43 and 2:!). On the first day John the Baptist affirmed: there is one among you whom you do not know. We see how, during the week, John the Baptist was the first to discover Jesus. Then later, John, Andrew and Simon also discovered him. The last day of the first week will be at the wedding in Cana, wheres Jesus will let them discover his glory. What are you looking for? (v.38). John did not forget these first words Jesus spoke to them. We want to know who jesus is, but he asks us what our inner dispositions are: because we will gain nothing through finding him unless we are disposed to submit ourselves to him. These two disciples began to live with Jesus. With time, they would discover that he is the Teacher, the Messiah, the son of God. So, too, with us. We progress in this knowledge of Jesus Christ as we go on our journey through life. John the baptist was withouth jeaously; he had encouraged his disciples to follow Jesus, and later the first two brought others. Likewise, we come to Jesus becuse of another person who spoke to us of him, or involved us in an apostolic task. These two disciples recognized Jesus. It would be more exact to say that jesus recognized those whom the Father had entrusted to him. Thus he recognized Nathanael when he was under the fig tree (v. 48). Among the Jews, this expression referred to a teacher of the Law engaged in teaching religion, since ordinarily the taught under the shade of a tree. In the same way, Jesus recognized Simon whom the Father chose to be the first Rock of the Church (Mt 16:13). You will see the heavens opened. See Genesis 28:12.</li>

It would be more exact to say that jesus recognized those whom the Father had entrusted to him. Thus he recognized Nathanael when he was under the fig tree (v. 48). Among the Jews, this expression referred to a teacher of the Law engaged in teaching religion, since ordinarily the taught under the shade of a tree. In the same way, Jesus recognized Simon whom the Father chose to be the first Rock of the Church (Mt 16:13). You will see the heavens opened. See Genesis 28:12.</li>
<li id="annotation-3">Jn 1,1 In the beginning was the Word. The real beginning is not the creation of the universe. For this beginning of time, space, matter, existence explains nothing yet demands an explanation. The real beginning is beyond time. John does not say that at this beginning God was because we know it. He speaks of the Word. We keep this traditional term word, although the term word that John uses says more than word. It is both thought and word, that is the word expressing what one carries in oneself. We ought perhaps translate with: The Expression of the Father, or to speak of his Son, is the same thing. In other pages he will be called Splendor (Heb 1:1) and Image (Col 1:15) of the Father. The Son is not part of the Father, or another God since he has nothing which is of himself but all which is the Father's is also his (Jn 16:15). John will remind us that no one has seen God (v. 18). The Father from whom existence comes and all that exits is without beginning and his springing forth is known only to himself. John tell us here that for him, being, is communicating himself, expressing himself, giving himself. God expresses himself in him who is at the same time his Word and his son and through this uncreated, unique Word, which fully expresses him, he creates a universe which is yet another way of saying what is in God. This is still not enough to satisfy the need of God to communicate himself. As several texts of the Old Testament have already said (Pro 8:22 and 31, 2 S 7:2-30), God has entered through his Word into the history of humanking. It was he who was spoken of in their own way by all who carried the Word, all the prophets of the Bible and those of other religions as well. The Word enlightened all human beigns, including those who did not know God; he was the conscience of the upright in every race, in every age. This Word, Son and expression of the Father came one day to give us the definitive word by means of his own existence in becoming human among us. Whatever has come to be, found life in him (v.4). It is a property of life to develop from within until maturity reached. This growth is to be seen throught history in all the work of the Word; it is the language of God which develops among humankind. Whether we study the history of our race from its origins, or wheter we read the Old Testament, we see how the language of God has been developed among humans. It always was a human language, but this language was inhabiated by the Spirit of God, and in a special way within the history of Israel, it was also the word of God. We shall find this living word in him who is the son-made-human, Jesus, but in a way which disconcerts us. For there is the mystery about the Son: it is true that he is God like the Father, but having received all, he is in a posture of offering: he empties himself so that the Father may exalt and glorify him anew. A man came, sent by God. Twice in verses 6-8 and 25, John, the author of the Gospel, speaks to us of John the Baptist, precursor of Jesus. The Word has truly identified himself: he has not come with glory; he was introduced by a word which came from himself, but remained human in John's preaching. It was easy to reject this witness and in fact when he came to his own, to the people of Israel, his own did not receive him. The Word was made flesh. John uses the word flesh to underline the utter humility of God who, despite being spirit, became a creature with a mortal body. John says: was made, and not: took the apprearance of a human person, because the Son of God was truly human. God become human dwelt among us. The root sense of this verb dwell in the Bible is: to have one's tent pitched. So John is pleased to allude to the sacred tent that seerved as the Hebrews' sanctuary in the desert: in that tent, God was present beside them (Ex 33:7-11). In reality Jesus, the Son of God become human, is the true Temple of God among people (Jn 2:21), a temple as humble and apparently fragile as the tent in the desert was: nevertheless, in him is the fullness of God. The apostles saw his glory at certain moments of his mortal life (Jn 2:11 and Lk 9:32). The saw his glory in his Passion and Resurrection. How does the Word save us? John does not speak only of Jesus rescuing us from the abyss of sin; he prefers to speak of Jesus allowing us to attain a status totally unexpected and beyond our reach: he made them children of God. We are mae children of God by the very son of the Father, provided tthat we believe in his Name, that is in his divine personality. In him was the fullness of Love and Truth (v. 14). Love (or Grace) and Truth (or Faithfulness) are God's two main qualities (Ex 34:6-7). These words are repeated as a refrain throughout Psalm 89. John, means then that he has recognized the fullness of Jesus' divinity (Col 2:29). God has given us the Law. While recounting the sins of Israel, the biblical story foretold the time when theres would be no need for a Law engraved in stones or written in books (Jer 31:31). Some day God would change the sinners' hearts (Ezk 36:26) son that relationships of mutual Love and Faithfulness between God and humankind would begin (Hos 2:21-22). John affirms that the promised time of Love and Truth (of perfect religion) arrived through Jesus Christ. Jn 1,19 THE LAMB The authorities wondered: Who is this who on his own initiative has begun to preach? At that time, varius Jewish groups baztized, or bathed, as a means of purification and to hasten the coming of the Messiah. Regarding John the Baptist's preaching and baptism, see Luke 3:10. The Messiah is the name the Jews gave to the expected Savior. They also expected the Prophet, but it was not clear whether or not the Prophet would be someone other than the Messiah. It was believed that the prophet Elijah would reappear before the Messiah's arrival (Mk 9:11). There is the Lamb (v. 29). In the language of the Jews, the word Lamb can mean both servant and lamb. Jesus is the Servant of God spoken of by the prophets, who was to sacrifice himself for his brothers and sisters. He is also the true Lamb that replaces the Paschal Lamb (Mk 14:12). A man comes after me (v. 30). In history, Jesus appears after John, but being the Word of God, he existed before all creatures. He also precedes, that is to say, all - including John the Baptist - are guided by his light. Jn 1,35 DISCOVERING JESUS This gospel is the work of John the Evangelist who should not be confused with John the Baptist. John the evangelist was one of the first two disciples to follow Jesus (vv. 39). John, concerned about helping us understand the profound meaning of Jesus' actions, dwells pay attention. For example, the Bible begins with the poem describing Creation as happening in seven ddays, and because John sees Jesus' work as a new creation, he describes the beginning of Jesus' public ministry as happening within a week (seven being a symbolic number) (v. 29 35, 43 and 2:!). On the first day John the Baptist affirmed: there is one among you whom you do not know. We see how, during the week, John the Baptist was the first to discover Jesus. Then later, John, Andrew and Simon also discovered him. The last day of the first week will be at the wedding in Cana, wheres Jesus will let them discover his glory. What are you looking for? (v.38). John did not forget these first words Jesus spoke to them. We want to know who jesus is, but he asks us what our inner dispositions are: because we will gain nothing through finding him unless we are disposed to submit ourselves to him. These two disciples began to live with Jesus. With time, they would discover that he is the Teacher, the Messiah, the son of God. So, too, with us. We progress in this knowledge of Jesus Christ as we go on our journey through life. John the baptist was withouth jeaously; he had encouraged his disciples to follow Jesus, and later the first two brought others. Likewise, we come to Jesus becuse of another person who spoke to us of him, or involved us in an apostolic task. These two disciples recognized Jesus. It would be more exact to say that jesus recognized those whom the Father had entrusted to him. Thus he recognized Nathanael when he was under the fig tree (v. 48). Among the Jews, this expression referred to a teacher of the Law engaged in teaching religion, since ordinarily the taught under the shade of a tree. In the same way, Jesus recognized Simon whom the Father chose to be the first Rock of the Church (Mt 16:13). You will see the heavens opened. See Genesis 28:12.</li>
