<p><sup>6</sup><span value="6">If any of you should cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble and fall, it would be better for you to be thrown into the depths of the sea with a great millstone around your neck.</span></p>
<p><sup>7</sup><span value="7">Woe to the world because of so many scandals! Scandals necessarily come, but woe to the one who has brought it about.</span></p>
<p><sup>8</sup><span value="8">If your hand or foot drags you into sin, cut it off and throw it away.

It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to be thrown into the fire of hell with your two eyes.</span></p>

<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Mt 18,1 Here we have the beginning of the fourth Discourse of Matthew's Gospel, not very consonant but centered on the life of the community. Those who say Our Father are not isolated. In place of the nation of Israel, Jesus offers them his Church, which is first of all community of communities. 6-11: concern for the little ones; 12-14: care for those who have strayed; 15-20: a fraternal community in the presence of Christ; 21-35: a community of pardon. For the commentary on vv. 1-5 see Mk 9:33. THE LITTLE ONES With v. 5 we pass from the children to the little ones, that is, simple people (such a child refers perhaps to the lowly one). They are little, because they do not count for much in society. Woe to the world because of so many scandals. Must we recall the real meaning of the word scandal? Scandalon in Greek is the little pebble that when unnoticed causes a fall: scandal is not something that makes noise or causes a stir in society but which leads consciences astray and causes those who seemed honest to fall. Jesus then speaks (v. 7) of the harm caused by social pressures. Many times the little ones strive to raise their standard of living and become more self-reliant, better educated and able to earn more. Often enough, society puts obstacles in the way of anyone who does not want to play dirty and who refuses to imitate the lifestyle of selfish persons. Because of this, the little ones will have to give up, to accept failure, to lose an eye before losing the most important thing, which is to live in the sight of God. It is better for you to enter life without a hand or a foot. Jesus stresses the incomparable value of eternal life. At times, to gain the Kingdom we will have to sacrifice even our job, our security and our life. Woe to the world, because of so many scandals (v. 7). Sometimes it is an individual who leads others to sin; at other times it is society itself with its corruption, violence and unjust social structures. Jesus invites us to be aware of sin, personal and social: the bad structures will be destroyed, no matter how, by tears and blood (Lk 23:28). These scandals necessarily come. Jesus lived in a world of violence, but apparently he did not complain about the situation. He did not encourage us to dream of paradise on earth. While some Christian communities aspire to be a flock of sheep meekly surrounding their shepherd, Jesus has a different vision of Christian life. The real world, the one God is saving, was not created to be an oasis of happiness, but a place where free persons grow through their struggles. Scandals are part and parcel of this world, but the power of evil does not diminish in any way the glory that God will receive in the end. Through suffering and hunger for justice God will awaken love and make it grow. Verse 10: See commentary on Dn 12:6. Mt 18,12 The parable of the one hundred sheep is also found in the gospel of Luke (15:1). It teaches us several things: Jesus' special concern for sinners and those who stray and, therefore, the missionary dimension of his apostolate. In fact, Jesus came to seek and save the lost (Lk 19:10), to call the outcasts, not the respectable people (Mt 9:13). This attitude should impel our parishes and Christian communities to constantly reach out to the unchurched and marginalized, instead of just working with those who already are in touch with the Church. Mt 18,15 If your brother has sinned... Jesus had told Peter before: Whatever you tie on earth will be tied in Heaven. He declares it now for the whole Church. The believers must attempt to settle their suits among themselves, knowing that Christ is among them, as signified in his name Emmanuel: God-with-us. The text of 18:15 is doubtful. Perhaps it was written if your brother has sinned, go talk... In which case it would refer to the effort of the Christian community to correct one who has gone astray. Gathered in the name of Jesus (v. 20). The prayer of the community, of the apostolic group, of the Christian couple. Have we noticed that this chapter on the Church is so short? Yet Matthew is the one who is most concerned about the Church of Jesus, whether in the parables of the kingdom or in Peter's profession of faith. Jesus does not seem to have said anything whatsoever to his apostles about structures that would emerge (or even disappear): nothing but a community spirit. Welcome for the poor and lowly, never-ending forgiveness and acceptance of others, prayer of a community that has apostolic ambitions and cries to God to give what is asked of him; there we have the sum total of the wisdom and means the Church has in order to confront all that challenges its evangelization. While we participate in the common activities, overcoming unavoidable conflicts, and persevering in apostolic work, we grow as children of God in truth, thus knowing the Father in truth. The Church, therefore, is that sacred place where we find God, and to express this reality we say that the Church is the sacrament of God. We also speak of several sacraments: baptism, eucharist... Some people want to receive the sacraments without having any commitment to the Church; they forget that religious rites confer the grace of God because they are gestures of the Church, which is the sacrament of God. God is not contained inside things, but rather reveals himself through the family of Christ, where he wants us to find him: Whatever you tie on earth... Our faithfulness within the Christian community, even if we have to dissent from it, is a sign that we are in the grace of God. Mt 18,21 Seventy-seven times. Compare with Genesis 4:24. Forgiveness must replace the thirst for revenge. This is about the forgiveness of one who returns repentant: see Luke 17:1. Mt 18,23 THE PARDON The offenses we suffer from our companions are nothing compared with our offenses against God. While God forgives all, we do not even give others enough breathing space. God does not demand his rights, but we, in demanding them, behave like wicked servants (see Mt 5:43). This parable goes beyond personal problems. The world needs, above everything else, the forgiveness of God, and those who want a more just society will not achieve it through accusations and hatred. The parable helps us understand much better another verse in the Bible: Revenge is mine, says the Lord; I will pay each one according to his own conduct. God will not demand an account regarding his own rights, (what we owe him), but regarding the rights of the little ones who, unable to pay, were deprived of them. He will also demand an accounting regarding those who were sorry for their sins but were not forgiven by others. The fourth Discourse of Matthew's Gospel ends with this parable on the duty to forgive. The Church has not always been as holy as she should have been. Yet nobody can deny that, at all times, in the Church the mercy of God has been preached and people have learned to forgive.</li>

Perhaps it was written if your brother has sinned, go talk... In which case it would refer to the effort of the Christian community to correct one who has gone astray. Gathered in the name of Jesus (v. 20). The prayer of the community, of the apostolic group, of the Christian couple. Have we noticed that this chapter on the Church is so short? Yet Matthew is the one who is most concerned about the Church of Jesus, whether in the parables of the kingdom or in Peter's profession of faith. Jesus does not seem to have said anything whatsoever to his apostles about structures that would emerge (or even disappear): nothing but a community spirit. Welcome for the poor and lowly, never-ending forgiveness and acceptance of others, prayer of a community that has apostolic ambitions and cries to God to give what is asked of him; there we have the sum total of the wisdom and means the Church has in order to confront all that challenges its evangelization. While we participate in the common activities, overcoming unavoidable conflicts, and persevering in apostolic work, we grow as children of God in truth, thus knowing the Father in truth. The Church, therefore, is that sacred place where we find God, and to express this reality we say that the Church is the sacrament of God. We also speak of several sacraments: baptism, eucharist... Some people want to receive the sacraments without having any commitment to the Church; they forget that religious rites confer the grace of God because they are gestures of the Church, which is the sacrament of God. God is not contained inside things, but rather reveals himself through the family of Christ, where he wants us to find him: Whatever you tie on earth... Our faithfulness within the Christian community, even if we have to dissent from it, is a sign that we are in the grace of God. Mt 18,21 Seventy-seven times. Compare with Genesis 4:24. Forgiveness must replace the thirst for revenge. This is about the forgiveness of one who returns repentant: see Luke 17:1. Mt 18,23 THE PARDON The offenses we suffer from our companions are nothing compared with our offenses against God. While God forgives all, we do not even give others enough breathing space. God does not demand his rights, but we, in demanding them, behave like wicked servants (see Mt 5:43). This parable goes beyond personal problems. The world needs, above everything else, the forgiveness of God, and those who want a more just society will not achieve it through accusations and hatred. The parable helps us understand much better another verse in the Bible: Revenge is mine, says the Lord; I will pay each one according to his own conduct. God will not demand an account regarding his own rights, (what we owe him), but regarding the rights of the little ones who, unable to pay, were deprived of them. He will also demand an accounting regarding those who were sorry for their sins but were not forgiven by others. The fourth Discourse of Matthew's Gospel ends with this parable on the duty to forgive. The Church has not always been as holy as she should have been. Yet nobody can deny that, at all times, in the Church the mercy of God has been preached and people have learned to forgive.</li>
<li id="annotation-4">Mt 18,1 Here we have the beginning of the fourth Discourse of Matthew's Gospel, not very consonant but centered on the life of the community. Those who say Our Father are not isolated. In place of the nation of Israel, Jesus offers them his Church, which is first of all community of communities. 6-11: concern for the little ones; 12-14: care for those who have strayed; 15-20: a fraternal community in the presence of Christ; 21-35: a community of pardon. For the commentary on vv. 1-5 see Mk 9:33. THE LITTLE ONES With v. 5 we pass from the children to the little ones, that is, simple people (such a child refers perhaps to the lowly one). They are little, because they do not count for much in society. Woe to the world because of so many scandals. Must we recall the real meaning of the word scandal? Scandalon in Greek is the little pebble that when unnoticed causes a fall: scandal is not something that makes noise or causes a stir in society but which leads consciences astray and causes those who seemed honest to fall. Jesus then speaks (v. 7) of the harm caused by social pressures. Many times the little ones strive to raise their standard of living and become more self-reliant, better educated and able to earn more. Often enough, society puts obstacles in the way of anyone who does not want to play dirty and who refuses to imitate the lifestyle of selfish persons. Because of this, the little ones will have to give up, to accept failure, to lose an eye before losing the most important thing, which is to live in the sight of God. It is better for you to enter life without a hand or a foot. Jesus stresses the incomparable value of eternal life. At times, to gain the Kingdom we will have to sacrifice even our job, our security and our life. Woe to the world, because of so many scandals (v. 7). Sometimes it is an individual who leads others to sin; at other times it is society itself with its corruption, violence and unjust social structures. Jesus invites us to be aware of sin, personal and social: the bad structures will be destroyed, no matter how, by tears and blood (Lk 23:28). These scandals necessarily come. Jesus lived in a world of violence, but apparently he did not complain about the situation. He did not encourage us to dream of paradise on earth. While some Christian communities aspire to be a flock of sheep meekly surrounding their shepherd, Jesus has a different vision of Christian life. The real world, the one God is saving, was not created to be an oasis of happiness, but a place where free persons grow through their struggles. Scandals are part and parcel of this world, but the power of evil does not diminish in any way the glory that God will receive in the end. Through suffering and hunger for justice God will awaken love and make it grow. Verse 10: See commentary on Dn 12:6. Mt 18,12 The parable of the one hundred sheep is also found in the gospel of Luke (15:1). It teaches us several things: Jesus' special concern for sinners and those who stray and, therefore, the missionary dimension of his apostolate. In fact, Jesus came to seek and save the lost (Lk 19:10), to call the outcasts, not the respectable people (Mt 9:13). This attitude should impel our parishes and Christian communities to constantly reach out to the unchurched and marginalized, instead of just working with those who already are in touch with the Church. Mt 18,15 If your brother has sinned... Jesus had told Peter before: Whatever you tie on earth will be tied in Heaven. He declares it now for the whole Church. The believers must attempt to settle their suits among themselves, knowing that Christ is among them, as signified in his name Emmanuel: God-with-us. The text of 18:15 is doubtful.
