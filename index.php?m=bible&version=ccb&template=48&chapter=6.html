                                                        <h4>Is he not the carpenter?</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>1</sup><span value="1"><a id="text-ann-1" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-1')" class="annotation"><sup> ① </sup></a>Leaving that place, Jesus returned to his own country, and his disciples followed him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>2</sup><span value="2">When the Sabbath came, he began teaching in the synagogue, and most of those who heard him were astonished. They commented, “How did this come to him? What kind of wisdom has been given to him that he also performs such miracles?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>3</sup><span value="3">Who is he but the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James and Joset and Judas and Simon? His sisters, too, are they not here among us?” So they took offense at him.</span></p>
<p><sup>4</sup><span value="4">And Jesus said to them, “Prophets are despised only in their own country, among their relatives and in their own family.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>5</sup><span value="5">And he could work no miracles there, but only healed a few sick people by laying his hands on them.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>6</sup><span value="6"><a id="text-ann-2" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-2')" class="annotation"><sup> ② </sup></a>Jesus himself was astounded at their unbelief.</span></p>
<h4>Jesus sends out the Twelve</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>7</sup><span value="7">Jesus then went around the villages teaching. He called the Twelve to him and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over evil spirits.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>8</sup><span value="8">And he ordered them to take nothing for the journey except a staff; no food, no bag, no money in their belts.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>9</sup><span value="9">They were to wear sandals and were not to take an extra tunic.</span></p>
<p><sup>10</sup><span value="10">And he added, “In whatever house you are welcomed, stay there until you leave the place.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>11</sup><span value="11">If any place doesn’t receive you and the people refuse to listen to you, leave after shaking the dust off your feet. It will be a testimony against them.”</span></p>
<p><sup>12</sup><span value="12">So they set out to proclaim that this was the time to repent.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>13</sup><span value="13">They drove out many demons and healed many sick people by anointing them.</span></p>
<h4>John the Baptist beheaded</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>14</sup><span value="14"><a id="text-ann-3" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-3')" class="annotation"><sup> ③ </sup></a>King Herod also heard about Jesus because his name had become well-known. Some people said, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>15</sup><span value="15">Others thought, “He is Elijah,” and others, “He is a prophet like the prophets of times past.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>16</sup><span value="16">When Herod was told of this, he thought: “I had John beheaded, yet he has risen from the dead!”</span></p>
<p><sup>17</sup><span value="17">For this is what had happened. Herod had ordered John to be arrested and had him bound and put in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. Herod had married her</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>18</sup><span value="18">and John had told him, “It is not right for you to live with your brother’s wife.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>19</sup><span value="19">So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him, but she could not</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>20</sup><span value="20">because Herod respected John. He knew John to be an upright and holy man and kept him safe. And he liked listening to him, although he became very disturbed whenever he heard him.</span></p>
<p><sup>21</sup><span value="21">Herodias had her chance on Herod’s birthday, when he gave a dinner for all the senior government officials, military chiefs and the leaders of Galilee.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>22</sup><span value="22">On that occasion the daughter of Herodias came in and danced; and she delighted Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>23</sup><span value="23">And he went so far as to say with many oaths, “I will give you anything you ask, even half my kingdom.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>24</sup><span value="24">She went out to consult her mother, “What shall I ask for?” The mother replied, “The head of John the Baptist.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>25</sup><span value="25">The girl hurried to the king and made her request: “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist, here and now, on a dish.”</span></p>
<p><sup>26</sup><span value="26">The king was very displeased, but he would not refuse in front of his guests because of his oaths.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>27</sup><span value="27">So he sent one of the bodyguards with orders to bring John’s head. He went and beheaded John in prison;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>28</sup><span value="28">then he brought the head on a dish and gave it to the girl. And the girl gave it to her mother.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>29</sup><span value="29">When John’s disciples heard of this, they came and took his body and buried it.</span></p>
<h4>Jesus, shepherd and prophet</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>30</sup><span value="30"><a id="text-ann-4" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-4')" class="annotation"><sup> ④ </sup></a>The apostles returned and reported to Jesus all they had done and taught.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>31</sup><span value="31">Then he said to them, “Go off by yourselves to a remote place and have some rest.” For there were so many people coming and going that the apostles had no time even to eat.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>32</sup><span value="32">And they went away in the boat to a secluded area by themselves.</span></p>
<p><sup>33</sup><span value="33">But people saw them leaving and many could guess where they were going. So, from all the towns they hurried there on foot, arriving ahead of them.</span></p>
<p><sup>34</sup><span value="34">As Jesus went ashore he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on them for they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began a long teaching session with them.</span></p>
<h4>First miracle of the loaves</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>35</sup><span value="35"><a id="text-ann-5" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-5')" class="annotation"><sup> ⑤ </sup></a>It was now getting late, so his disciples came to him and said, “This is a lonely place and it is now late.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>36</sup><span value="36">You should send the people away and let them go to the farms and villages around here to buy themselves something to eat.”</span></p>
<p><sup>37</sup><span value="37">Jesus replied, “You yourselves give them something to eat.” They answered, “If we are to give them food, we must go and buy two hundred silver coins’ worth of bread.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>38</sup><span value="38">But Jesus said, “You have some loaves: how many? Go and see.” The disciples found out and said, “There are five loaves and two fish.”</span></p>
<p><sup>39</sup><span value="39">Then he told them to have the people sit down together in groups on the green grass.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>40</sup><span value="40">This they did in groups of hundreds and fifties.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>41</sup><span value="41">And Jesus took the five loaves and the two fish and, raising his eyes to heaven, he pronounced a blessing, broke the loaves and handed them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them.</span></p>
<p><sup>42</sup><span value="42">They all ate and everyone had enough.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>43</sup><span value="43">The disciples gathered up what was left and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces of bread and fish.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>44</sup><span value="44">Five thousand men had eaten there.</span></p>
<h4>Jesus walks on the water</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>45</sup><span value="45"><a id="text-ann-6" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-6')" class="annotation"><sup> ⑥ </sup></a>Immediately, Jesus obliged his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, towards Bethsaida, while he himself sent the crowd away.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>46</sup><span value="46">And having sent the people off, he went by himself to the hillside to pray.</span></p>
<p><sup>47</sup><span value="47">When evening came, the boat was far out on the lake while he was alone on the land.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>48</sup><span value="48">Jesus saw his disciples straining at the oars, for the wind was against them, and before daybreak he came to them walking on the lake; and he was going to pass them by.</span></p>
<p><sup>49</sup><span value="49">When they saw him walking on the lake, they thought it was a ghost and cried out;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>50</sup><span value="50">for they all saw him and were terrified. But at once he called to them, “Courage! It’s me; don’t be afraid.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>51</sup><span value="51">Then Jesus got into the boat with them and the wind died down. They were completely astonished,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>52</sup><span value="52">for they had not really grasped the fact of the loaves; their minds were dull.</span></p>
<p><sup>53</sup><span value="53">Having crossed the lake, they came ashore at Gennesaret where they tied up the boat.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>54</sup><span value="54">As soon as they landed, people recognized Jesus</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>55</sup><span value="55">and ran to spread the news throughout the countryside. Wherever he was they brought to him the sick lying on their mats.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>56</sup><span value="56">And wherever he went, to villages, towns or farms, they laid the sick in the marketplace and begged him to let them touch just the fringe of his cloak. And all who touched him were cured.</span></p>
<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Mk 6,1 THE WISDOM OF JESUS The brothers and sisters of Jesus are his relatives and acquaintances of Nazareth: see commentary on Mark 3:31. How did this come to him? Does this mean that Jesus traveled to other countries in order to get magic powers? See the answer in the commentary on Matthew 2:23. Because he always lived among them and never did anything extraordinary, they were astonished that, in such a short time, he became famous throughout Galilee. In fact they do not know him: most of the time people mistakenly believe they know their neighbors. A prophet is despised only in his own country (v. 4). After living with him so long and treating him like anyone else, how could they suddenly show respect and have faith in him? Who is he but the carpenter? (v. 3). The term the Gospel uses is craftsman. There is no further specification. Yet the first Christians of Palestine asserted that Jesus was a carpenter. What kind of wisdom has been given to him? Many people say that because Christ was God he knew all things, but divine knowledge is nothing less than God himself. He knows all at once in an instant that never ends - this is eternity. On the other hand, humans think in ideas, and do not embrace all at the same time. That is why, from birth, Jesus had to learn from experience and discover. Yet he had a clear awareness that he was the Son, although at the beginning he did not have the words to think or express this. Jesus received his human learning from Mary, Joseph, and his neighbors in Nazareth. He acquired his wisdom from the Bible and the culture of his people. Yet the Father gave him his Spirit to judge as God does and to recognize God in all things. For him (as for us now) what was important was not accumulating data and experiences but to be able to appreciate all that occurred. Jesus, inspired by the Spirit, felt all the realities of life in a different way: this was Wisdom. Mk 6,6 THE MISSION See commentary on Matthew 10:5; Luke 10:1; Matthew 28:16. Jesus begins a third stage of his ministry by organizing a mission throughout the province. Before, the apostles accompanied Jesus but now he sends them ahead of him. Jesus is an educator. He not only teaches his followers, he has them share in his mission. His apostles must also proclaim their faith and perform healings as the Master does. By doing this, they put into practice what they have discovered of the kingdom of God. The disciples should be first to believe what they themselves proclaim: God makes himself present. Because of this, they must live day by day, trusting in the Father's Providence, not frightened but always conscious of God's mission and power. Oil was used at the time as a remedy, but Jesus gives it a new meaning: the healings bring more than just well-being, they are also the sign of spiritual healing, the reconciliation of people with God. Jesus' concern to form communities of believers is already present. He sends his disciples out two by two so that the message will not be from one person only, but the expression of a group united in one mission. Jesus tells them to stay under one roof with one family so that this may be a center radiating faith. Mk 6,14 King Herod. This refers to Herod Antipas, son of the other Herod who reigned when Jesus was born. King Herod respected John, but he was prisoner of his milieu and of his vices. As king of Galilee, his misconduct constituted a public counter-witness. All through the Bible we see prophets stressing the particular responsibility of those who wield power. If they have to lead the people, they must be, by the rectitude of their life, an example; John the Baptist could not speak of justice without reproaching Herod for his infidelity. People said that John the Baptist has been raised from the dead (6:14). They considered John a martyr and believed he would rise from the dead to punish Herod. Some associated Jesus with John - Jesus performed miracles that John had not done. Others, less informed, thought Jesus was an apparition of John. Mk 6,30 The apostles are exhausted. At the end of this journey they need to rest and take a deeper look at their experiences. Jesus teaches them and helps them reflect upon what they had seen and done. Many people coming and going. After the disciples had gone through the villages of Galilee many people wanted to know who had sent them, and the crowd approached Jesus. He had compassion on them (v. 34). The Old Testament had shown the compassion of God as a Father, but now Jesus reveals this compassion in a different way. No one could fully understand the mercy of God until the Son came to share everything with us, making himself poor among the poor, able to feel with them instead of giving them his words and deeds of mercy from above. This compassion of Jesus helps us understand that Christian commitment to the poor is not complete as long as the Church is not itself deeply rooted in the lower class of society. They were like sheep without a shepherd (Num 27:17; Is 40:11; Ezk 34; Zec 11:4-17; 12:8). This refers to people who had not yet found true community, and Jesus had pity on them. The prophet Ezekiel reproached the leaders of Israel for being bad pastors, but today he might reproach us for failing to be pastors and prophets in the midst of our world. Why should we so often wait for priests, religious or a few hand-picked lay people to take the initiative of assembling new communities? Why are we so timid in proposing to those who are outside the light of faith that we have gratuitously received and allow them to discover in the group or community this richness? And he began a long teaching session with them. What did he tell them? All that makes up the Gospel. Penetrating everyone's conscience with a prophetic gaze, Jesus showed each one where the real problem lay. Speaking like the prophets, Jesus never enclosed and isolated the people within their personal problems: their personal progress had to be attained together with the renewal of their environment. Jesus saw that they were burdened with difficulties but would lift them up by giving them signs of hope. In any situation there is something that we can do immediately to uplift ourselves; and even before any attempt of ours, God already gives us signs that he does not abandon us and that we must trust totally in him. Mk 6,35 The Bible says that from the mouth of God comes bread, and the Word that we need (Dt 8:3). By the act of giving bread, Jesus demonstrates that his words are God's words. God gives bread to his people (Ex 16; Ps 72:16; Ps 81:17; Ps 132:15; 147:14). What comes from the mouth of God (Dt 8:3; Wis 16:26; Mt 4:4). Seen in the light of the Old Testament, this narration identifies Jesus as the Shepherd foretold by the prophets. They sat in fresh pastures (Ps 23), and they were all satisfied (Ps 78:29). The crowd seated for a meal is the image of the Reign when Jesus will unite all of humanity in the fraternal banquet of God (Lk 14:15). Raising his eyes to heaven (v. 41). By using this gesture, rather than a prayer that saints or prophets might have said on this occasion, Jesus expresses his personal relationship with the Father. Jesus is the bread needed by humanity (Jn 6). God has set on this earth all that humanity needs for food and development, but if we do not know how to listen to the Word, we will not know how to solve the world's most urgent problem, the distribution of the riches of the earth. Faith in God's promises is the only force with which to fight against egoism and unequal privileges, and it will eventually obtain food, peace, and freedom for all. Because of this, Jesus had compassion for this crowd whose leaders had little concern for them. Without bothering about food, this crowd sat listening to him while he conveyed to them the word of God which liberates people from blindness and emptiness. Then, being the Shepherd and the True Bread of Life, he gave them food and distributed it. Mk 6,45 Jesus obliged them to get into the boat. Why? John's Gospel explains this (Jn 6:15). Because the people, enthused by the miracle, wanted to make him a king and liberator sent by God. Even the apostles were eager for this to happen.</li>

The term the Gospel uses is craftsman. There is no further specification. Yet the first Christians of Palestine asserted that Jesus was a carpenter. What kind of wisdom has been given to him? Many people say that because Christ was God he knew all things, but divine knowledge is nothing less than God himself. He knows all at once in an instant that never ends - this is eternity. On the other hand, humans think in ideas, and do not embrace all at the same time. That is why, from birth, Jesus had to learn from experience and discover. Yet he had a clear awareness that he was the Son, although at the beginning he did not have the words to think or express this. Jesus received his human learning from Mary, Joseph, and his neighbors in Nazareth. He acquired his wisdom from the Bible and the culture of his people. Yet the Father gave him his Spirit to judge as God does and to recognize God in all things. For him (as for us now) what was important was not accumulating data and experiences but to be able to appreciate all that occurred. Jesus, inspired by the Spirit, felt all the realities of life in a different way: this was Wisdom. Mk 6,6 THE MISSION See commentary on Matthew 10:5; Luke 10:1; Matthew 28:16. Jesus begins a third stage of his ministry by organizing a mission throughout the province. Before, the apostles accompanied Jesus but now he sends them ahead of him. Jesus is an educator. He not only teaches his followers, he has them share in his mission. His apostles must also proclaim their faith and perform healings as the Master does. By doing this, they put into practice what they have discovered of the kingdom of God. The disciples should be first to believe what they themselves proclaim: God makes himself present. Because of this, they must live day by day, trusting in the Father's Providence, not frightened but always conscious of God's mission and power. Oil was used at the time as a remedy, but Jesus gives it a new meaning: the healings bring more than just well-being, they are also the sign of spiritual healing, the reconciliation of people with God. Jesus' concern to form communities of believers is already present. He sends his disciples out two by two so that the message will not be from one person only, but the expression of a group united in one mission. Jesus tells them to stay under one roof with one family so that this may be a center radiating faith. Mk 6,14 King Herod. This refers to Herod Antipas, son of the other Herod who reigned when Jesus was born. King Herod respected John, but he was prisoner of his milieu and of his vices. As king of Galilee, his misconduct constituted a public counter-witness. All through the Bible we see prophets stressing the particular responsibility of those who wield power. If they have to lead the people, they must be, by the rectitude of their life, an example; John the Baptist could not speak of justice without reproaching Herod for his infidelity. People said that John the Baptist has been raised from the dead (6:14). They considered John a martyr and believed he would rise from the dead to punish Herod. Some associated Jesus with John - Jesus performed miracles that John had not done. Others, less informed, thought Jesus was an apparition of John. Mk 6,30 The apostles are exhausted. At the end of this journey they need to rest and take a deeper look at their experiences. Jesus teaches them and helps them reflect upon what they had seen and done. Many people coming and going. After the disciples had gone through the villages of Galilee many people wanted to know who had sent them, and the crowd approached Jesus. He had compassion on them (v. 34). The Old Testament had shown the compassion of God as a Father, but now Jesus reveals this compassion in a different way. No one could fully understand the mercy of God until the Son came to share everything with us, making himself poor among the poor, able to feel with them instead of giving them his words and deeds of mercy from above. This compassion of Jesus helps us understand that Christian commitment to the poor is not complete as long as the Church is not itself deeply rooted in the lower class of society. They were like sheep without a shepherd (Num 27:17; Is 40:11; Ezk 34; Zec 11:4-17; 12:8). This refers to people who had not yet found true community, and Jesus had pity on them. The prophet Ezekiel reproached the leaders of Israel for being bad pastors, but today he might reproach us for failing to be pastors and prophets in the midst of our world. Why should we so often wait for priests, religious or a few hand-picked lay people to take the initiative of assembling new communities? Why are we so timid in proposing to those who are outside the light of faith that we have gratuitously received and allow them to discover in the group or community this richness? And he began a long teaching session with them. What did he tell them? All that makes up the Gospel. Penetrating everyone's conscience with a prophetic gaze, Jesus showed each one where the real problem lay. Speaking like the prophets, Jesus never enclosed and isolated the people within their personal problems: their personal progress had to be attained together with the renewal of their environment. Jesus saw that they were burdened with difficulties but would lift them up by giving them signs of hope. In any situation there is something that we can do immediately to uplift ourselves; and even before any attempt of ours, God already gives us signs that he does not abandon us and that we must trust totally in him. Mk 6,35 The Bible says that from the mouth of God comes bread, and the Word that we need (Dt 8:3). By the act of giving bread, Jesus demonstrates that his words are God's words. God gives bread to his people (Ex 16; Ps 72:16; Ps 81:17; Ps 132:15; 147:14). What comes from the mouth of God (Dt 8:3; Wis 16:26; Mt 4:4). Seen in the light of the Old Testament, this narration identifies Jesus as the Shepherd foretold by the prophets. They sat in fresh pastures (Ps 23), and they were all satisfied (Ps 78:29). The crowd seated for a meal is the image of the Reign when Jesus will unite all of humanity in the fraternal banquet of God (Lk 14:15). Raising his eyes to heaven (v. 41). By using this gesture, rather than a prayer that saints or prophets might have said on this occasion, Jesus expresses his personal relationship with the Father. Jesus is the bread needed by humanity (Jn 6). God has set on this earth all that humanity needs for food and development, but if we do not know how to listen to the Word, we will not know how to solve the world's most urgent problem, the distribution of the riches of the earth. Faith in God's promises is the only force with which to fight against egoism and unequal privileges, and it will eventually obtain food, peace, and freedom for all. Because of this, Jesus had compassion for this crowd whose leaders had little concern for them. Without bothering about food, this crowd sat listening to him while he conveyed to them the word of God which liberates people from blindness and emptiness. Then, being the Shepherd and the True Bread of Life, he gave them food and distributed it. Mk 6,45 Jesus obliged them to get into the boat. Why? John's Gospel explains this (Jn 6:15). Because the people, enthused by the miracle, wanted to make him a king and liberator sent by God. Even the apostles were eager for this to happen.</li>
