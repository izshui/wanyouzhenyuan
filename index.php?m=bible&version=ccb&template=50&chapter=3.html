                                                        <h4>Jesus and Nicodemus</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>1</sup><span value="1"><a id="text-ann-1" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-1')" class="annotation"><sup> ① </sup></a>Among the Pharisees there was a ruler of the Jews named Nicodemus.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>2</sup><span value="2">He came to Jesus by night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you have come from God to teach us, for no one can perform miraculous signs like yours unless God is with him.”</span></p>
<p><sup>3</sup><span value="3">Jesus replied, “Truly, I say to you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again from above.”</span></p>
<p><sup>4</sup><span value="4">Nicodemus said, “How can there be rebirth for a grown man? Who could go back to his mother’s womb and be born again?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>5</sup><span value="5">Jesus replied, “Truly, I say to you: No one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>6</sup><span value="6">What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>7</sup><span value="7">Because of this, don’t be surprised when I say: ‘You must be born again from above.’</span></p>
<p><sup>8</sup><span value="8">The wind blows where it pleases and you hear its sound, but you don’t know where it comes from or where it is going. It is like that with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</span></p>
<p><sup>9</sup><span value="9">Nicodemus asked again, “How can this be?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>10</sup><span value="10">And Jesus answered, “You are a teacher in Israel, and you don’t know these things!</span></p>
<p><sup>11</sup><span value="11"><a id="text-ann-2" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-2')" class="annotation"><sup> ② </sup></a>Truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and we witness to the things we have seen, but you don’t accept our testimony.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>12</sup><span value="12">If you don’t believe when I speak of earthly things, what then, when I speak to you of heavenly things?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>13</sup><span value="13">No one has ever gone up to heaven except the one who came from heaven, the Son of Man.</span></p>
<p><sup>14</sup><span value="14">As Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>15</sup><span value="15">so that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.</span></p>
<p><sup>16</sup><span value="16">Yes, God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that whoever believes in him may not be lost, but may have eternal life.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>17</sup><span value="17">God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world; instead, through him the world is to be saved.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>18</sup><span value="18">Who ever believes in him will not be condemned. He who does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the Name of the only Son of God.</span></p>
<p><sup>19</sup><span value="19">This is how the Judgment is made: Light has come into the world and people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>20</sup><span value="20">For whoever does wrong hates the light and doesn’t come to the light for fear that his deeds will be shown as evil.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>21</sup><span value="21">But whoever lives according to the truth comes into the light so that it can be clearly seen that his works have been done in God.”</span></p>
<h4>John the Baptist’s last testimony</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>22</sup><span value="22"><a id="text-ann-3" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-3')" class="annotation"><sup> ③ </sup></a>After this, Jesus went into the territory of Judea with his disciples. He stayed there with them and baptized.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>23</sup><span value="23">John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim where water was plentiful; people came to him and were baptized.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>24</sup><span value="24">This happened before John was put in prison.</span></p>
<p><sup>25</sup><span value="25">Now John’s disciples had been questioned by a Jew about spiritual cleansing,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>26</sup><span value="26">so they came to him and said, “Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, and about whom you spoke favorably, is now baptizing and all are going to him.”</span></p>
<p><sup>27</sup><span value="27">John answered, “No one can take on anything except what has been given him from heaven.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>28</sup><span value="28">You yourselves are my witnesses that I said: ‘I am not the Christ but I have been sent before him.’</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>29</sup><span value="29">Only the bridegroom has the bride; but the friend of the bridegroom stands by and listens, and rejoices to hear the bridegroom’s voice. My joy is now full.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>30</sup><span value="30">It is necessary that he increase but that I decrease.</span></p>
<p><sup>31</sup><span value="31">He who comes from above is above all; he who comes from the earth belongs to the earth and his words, too, are earthly. The One who comes from heav en</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>32</sup><span value="32">speaks of the things he has seen and heard; he bears witness to this but no one accepts his testi mony.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>33</sup><span value="33">Whoever does receive his testimony acknowledges the truthfulness of God.</span></p>
<p><sup>34</sup><span value="34">The one sent by God speaks God’s words and gives the Spirit without measure.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>35</sup><span value="35">For the Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything into his hands.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>36</sup><span value="36">Whoever believes in the Son lives with eternal life, but he who will not believe in the Son will never know life and always faces the justice of God.”</span></p>
<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Jn 3,1 A NEW BIRTH Nicodemus was a religius person, concerned about knowing God and his ways, and he went to Jesus as to a teacher of religion. What he needed was not so much to receive instruction, however, as to undergo a change within himself. That, too, is what we need. We must recognize our powerlessness - by ourselves, unaided - to pass through the barriers which block us from an authentic life. Like Nicodemus, despite all our accumulated experience and knowledge (or because of them), we are old people. Jesus says we must be born again and born from above: John's gospel uses a word which can be interpreted in both senses (v. 3). Nobody gives birth to himself, and just as we recevied our life in the flesh from others so, too, we recevie the life of the son of God from the Spirit. All calim that they live: something moves in them, thoughts come to them, and they make decisions... Yet this could possibly be nothing more than the life of the flesh, or the life of an unawakened person. The other life, that of the Spirit, is more mysterious because it takes place in the innermost depths of our being. We see the external appearance; we notice a person's face and behavior, but we do not see God's working in her. The awakened believer, however, who is habitually led by the spirit gradually discovers changes in what motivates her actions and her ambitions. She feels at ease with God and without fear, experiencing that it is not so much she who orients her life, as another who lives in her. Yet she could not, in fact, be able to say exactly what happens within her. Hence Jesus compares the action of the Spirit with the passing of the wind which we feel, although we do not see or hokd it. Let us also take note that in Jesus' language the same word means spirit as mch as wind. Whe have to be reborn of water and of the Spirit: this points to baptism. Let us not think that merely by receiving the waters of baptism, one is fully established in the life of the Spirit: rather, let us realize that normally one is baptized in order to begin the life of the spirit: the words of gospel refer to adults converted to the Christian faith. The case of infant baptism is different. Baptism works within them. Yet they should receive instruction in the faith to lead them to personal conversion. Like may in Israel, Nicodemus was a religious person and a believer. Why did he come by night? Possibly he did not want to risk his poistion and reputation, or mix with the common people around Jesus. This would not be the attitude of those who have been born again these have been liberated from many things that paralyze others. Jn 3,11 JESUS REVEALS THE PLAN OF GOD John's gospel is different from the other tree. Ofthen, after relating some words of Jesus, John adds an explanation of the faith, which he supports with declarations that Jesus made on other occasions. That is what happens in this case. How can this be? Nicodemus asked. To enter into the life of the Spirit, we need to know God's plan for us. Yet no one can speak properly of such things except the son of God. He has seen heavenly things, that is, the infimate life of God, he also speaks of earthly things, that is, of the Kingdom that God brings to us. Many of Jesus listeners will not accept what he says about the Reign of God; much less will they pay attention to what he reveals about the mystery of God. Jesus reveals to us that which, by ourselves, we are unable to know. Thus a christian is not one who merely believes in God; we are Christians because we believe the testimony of Jesus (v. 11) regarding God and his plan of salvation. In this plan, there was something very difficult to accept: that the son of Man would have to die on the cross and to rise from the dead (he lifted on high means the same). Jesus reminds them of the serpent in the desert. This episode in the Bible (Num 21) prefigured what would happen to Jesus. Of course, the Jews did not grasp the meaning of this message; in fact, they passed over all the predictions of the sufferings of their saviour without understanding them. They had to revise their ideas about other matters, also. The Jews had been praying for God to come and expected him to condemn the wold and to punich the bad. He, on the other hand, sent his own Son to the cross so that the wold will be saved (v. 17). Other verses of the New Testament say that we should not love the world; which seems to contradict what we have just read: God so loved the world. The reason for this contradiction is that the word world has several meanings. First, the world means all of creation, which is good since it is God's work. The center of this divine work is humankind, which has come under the influence of Satan (8:34  44). Everything that sinful humanity creates - riches, culture, social life - is influenced, disfigured and used for evil. Hence, God sent His son so that the world will be saved. Yet, even though Christ's resurrection initiated his invincible power over history, a strong current of evil coninues, dragging along al who refuse to acknowledge the truth. This evil current is sometimes calles the world. It would be more appropiate to say: the people who surrender themselves to the master of the world. The Scripture points to them in saying: Do not love the world, or You are not of the world (1 Jn 2:15; 4:6). Jn 3,22 The gospel admits that many disciples of John the Baptist did not recognize Jesus. They had been drawn by their teather's example: he was intense and outspoken, hard on himself in food, drink and clothing. Somehow they had the hope, maybe because of John the Baptist's manner, that God's true justice would come and bring about direct punishment of the wicked. Like militant followers of whatever good cause, John's disciples had this weakness: they were too focused on their own leaders and ways to consider other possibililities. To become Christ's disciples, they would have to give up their own prophets. It is necessary that he increase but that I decrease, says the greatest of the prophets (v. 30). Only Jesus comes from On High, and can fully satisfy the human heart. In him nothing of the good is lost, since he embodies all. Always faces the justice of God (v. 36). Those who do not recognize the son of God remain in the situation humanity was in when expelled from Paradise. If they are not able to receive the witness of God the son who is one with the Father, they will never solve the contradictions in their lives or in the world in which they live; and they cannot but mistrust God.</li>
