                                                        <p><sup>1</sup><span value="1">Then Pilate had Jesus taken away and scourged.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>2</sup><span value="2">The soldiers also twisted thorns into a crown and put it on his head. They threw a cloak of royal purple around his shoulders</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>3</sup><span value="3">and began coming up to him and saluting him, “Hail, king of the Jews,” and they struck him on the face.</span></p>
<p><sup>4</sup><span value="4">Pilate went outside yet another time and said to the Jews, “Look, I am bringing him out and I want you to know that I find no crime in him.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>5</sup><span value="5">Jesus then came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak and Pilate pointed to him saying, “Here is the man!”</span></p>
<p><sup>6</sup><span value="6">On seeing him the chief priests and the guards cried out, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” Pilate replied, “Take him yourselves and have him crucified, for I find no case against him.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>7</sup><span value="7">The Jews then said, “We have a Law, and according to the Law this man must die because he made himself Son of God.”</span></p>
<p><sup>8</sup><span value="8">When Pilate heard this he was more afraid.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>9</sup><span value="9">And coming back into the court he asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>10</sup><span value="10">Then Pilate said to him, “You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you just as I have power to crucify you?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>11</sup><span value="11">Jesus replied, “You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who handed me over to you is more guilty.”</span></p>
<p><sup>12</sup><span value="12">From that moment Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews cried out, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who makes himself king is defying Caesar.”</span></p>
<p><sup>13</sup><span value="13">When Pilate heard this, he had Jesus brought outside to the place called the Stone Floor – in Hebrew Gabbatha – and there he had him seated in the tribune.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>14</sup><span value="14">It was the Preparation Day for the Passover, about noon. So Pilate said to the Jews, “Here is your king.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>15</sup><span value="15">But they cried out, “Away! Take him away! Crucify him!” Pilate replied, “Shall I crucify your king?” And the chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.”</span></p>
<h4>Jesus is crucified</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>16</sup><span value="16">Then Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be crucified. They took charge of him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>17</sup><span value="17">Bearing his own cross, Jesus went out of the city to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew: Golgotha.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>18</sup><span value="18">There he was crucified and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus was in the middle.</span></p>
<p><sup>19</sup><span value="19">Pilate had a notice written and fastened to the cross that read: Jesus the Nazorean, King of the Jews.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>20</sup><span value="20">Many Jewish people saw this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was very close to the city. It was, moreover, written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>21</sup><span value="21">The chief priests said to Pilate, “Do not write: ‘The king of the Jews’; but: “This man claimed to be king of the Jews.’ ”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>22</sup><span value="22">Pilate answered them, “What I have written, I have written.”</span></p>
<p><sup>23</sup><span value="23">When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one part for each of them. But as the tunic was woven in one piece from top to bottom,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>24</sup><span value="24">they said, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots to decide who will get it.” This fulfilled the words of Scripture: They divided my clothing among them; they cast lots for my garment.This was what the soldiers did.</span></p>
<h4>Jesus’ last words</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>25</sup><span value="25"><a id="text-ann-1" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-1')" class="annotation"><sup> ① </sup></a>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister Mary, who was the wife of Cleophas, and Mary of Magdala.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>26</sup><span value="26">When Jesus saw the Mother, and the disciple whom he loved, he said to the Mother, “Woman, this is your son.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>27</sup><span value="27">Then he said to the disciple, “There is your mother.” And from that moment the disciple took her to his own home.</span></p>
<p><sup>28</sup><span value="28"><a id="text-ann-2" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-2')" class="annotation"><sup> ② </sup></a>With that Jesus knew all was now finished and he said, I am thirsty,to fulfill what was written in Scripture.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>29</sup><span value="29">A jar full of bitter wine stood there; so, putting a sponge soaked in the wine on a twig of hyssop, they raised it to his lips.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>30</sup><span value="30">Jesus took the wine and said, “It is accomplished.” Then he bowed his head and gave up the spirit.</span></p>
<h4>The pierced Christ</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>31</sup><span value="31"><a id="text-ann-3" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-3')" class="annotation"><sup> ③ </sup></a>As it was Preparation Day, the Jews did not want the bodies to remain on the cross during the Sabbath, for this Sabbath was a very solemn day. They asked Pilate to have the legs of the condemned men broken, so they might take away the bodies.</span></p>
<p><sup>32</sup><span value="32">The soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>33</sup><span value="33">When they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead; so they did not break his legs.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>34</sup><span value="34">One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a lance and immediately there came out blood and water.</span></p>
<p><sup>35</sup><span value="35">The one who has seen here gives his witness so that you may believe: his witness is true and He knows that he speaks the truth.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>36</sup><span value="36">All this happened to fulfill the words of Scripture, Not one of his bones shall be broken.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>37</sup><span value="37">Another text says: They shall look on him whom they have pierced.</span></p>
<p><sup>38</sup><span value="38"><a id="text-ann-4" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-4')" class="annotation"><sup> ④ </sup></a>After this, Joseph of Arimathea approached Pilate, for he was a disciple of Jesus, though secretly, for fear of the Jews. And he asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate agreed, so he came and took away the body.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>39</sup><span value="39">Nicodemus, the man who earlier had come to Jesus by night, also came and brought a jar of myrrh mixed with aloes, about a hundred pounds.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>40</sup><span value="40">They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, following the burial custom of the Jews.</span></p>
<p><sup>41</sup><span value="41">There was a garden in the place where Jesus had been crucified, and, in the garden, a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>42</sup><span value="42">As the tomb was very near, they buried Jesus there because they had no time left before the Jewish Preparation Day.</span></p>
<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Jn 19,25 THE MOTHER OF THE BELIEVERS At the moment of Man's fall, Eve was withadam. Now, at the moment of restoration, that is, the second creation, another woman is with the son of Man (the Human One), the second Adam. Mary has neither spouse nor son who can receive her and, for the Jews, a woman who re-mains alone would be considered cursed. Jesus entrust Mary to John and, also, John to Mary. John testifies having heard both phrases. Notice that he writes: jesus said to the Mother, and not, to his mother. This is a new symbolic gesture of Jesus. Mary will be the Mother of believers. Through this last deed of Jesus, the Church discovered something about the mystery of the Christian life. The believer is a member of a spiritual family. As a child needs a father and a mother to grow normally so, tood, does the believer need mary and the heavenly father. This is an unchanging doctrine of the Church, which is no way attempts to make the creature equal with the Creator. Not without reason has God given us a mother: if it is a misfortune for a child not to have known a mother, it is also a misfortune for a believer when his religion only expresses itself in masculine terms. The believer who welcome Mary to his home as did John is neither a fanatic nor a quibbler regarding faith. There exists a form of humility, joy, interior peace and simple piety characteristic of those Catholics who have known how to open their doors to Mary without throwing out their Savior. Jn 19,28 I am thirsty. Jesus is tortured by thirst. He also thirsts that the Kingdom of his Father be realized in the world. He thirsts for selfless love from those who may share his deepest thoughts and be willing to follow him until Calvary. It is accomplished. Jesus drank the cup of sorrow and humiliation to the las drop. The Father had placed it in his hands as the means for becoming the savior we need. The Work of the Son of God made flesh, which should be nothing less than a new creation of the world, is accomplished. The earthly existence of the son of God comes to an end, and from the sead planted in the earth will come forth the New Creature. The preparatory times of the Jewish religion, in which the Law occupied first place and the fear due to unforgiven sins was never lost, are finished. A stage of history has ended, in which the rest of humanity had been dragged by its fears and acceptance of its deadly fate, which was a form of its slavery to the Evil Spirit. Now begins a new era in history, the era of the new Covenant of God with humanity. The spirit will be communicated to the Church. John said: Jesus gave up the spirit, a word which also indicated that he was giving his Spirit to us. Jn 19,31 THE SACRED HEART In Jesus' death as in his life, there are many details that enable us to understand his sacrifice better, if we see them in the light of the Old Testament. In the piercing of Jesus' heart the words of the prophet Zechariah: They shall look on him whom they pierced (Zec 12:10) were literally fulfilled. The wounds of Jesus are seen by people of any religion as the distintive mark of Christian faith. Without needing words, they tell a way of self-sacrifice in which God made himself a model. God said through Zechariah that this is the moment in which sinners are converted. John also records a prescription of the Law regarding the Passover Lamb: Not one of his bones shall be broken (Ex 12: 46). This occurred at the death of Jesus, the true victim who took the place of the Passover Lamb. Blood and water came out. The Jews believed that only through the blood of their victims could they obtain God's pardon. Speaking poetically, first John, then later the Church, said that from the open breast of Christ came forth the sacrament of baptism and the Eucharist, water and blood. From the cross, forgiveness and new life have sprung forth for us. The open heart of Jeus invites us to discover the powerful, hidden and mysterious love that inspired his life. The disciples of Jesus, who had lived with him, would find that their memories and emotions would be diluted and disappear with time; they would discover, on the other had, that there had been no word, or deed or even silence of Jesus which had not been an expression of his love for God. From his open heart on the cross originates o ur devotion to the Heart of Jesus. Let us not get distracted by intellectual ideas in an attempt to explain or interpret faith; rather, let us comtemplate God's love and allow it to transform us, making us like unto him. Jn 19,38 Jesus has just died and it is two Pharisees who took care of giving him a decent burial. Joseph of Ariathea approached Pilate: because the disciples had no means of approaching the roman governor. Joseph and Nicodemus were disciples in secret. Because Jesus identified himself with the common people, it was difficult for those in better social positions to integrate themselves into his group. Here we have an example of the inevitable consequences of a preferential option for the poor. Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimatheaa, Lazarus and the women mentioned in Luke 8:2 were people of upper or middle class. This fact was enough for some scholars to hastily conclude that Jesus did not live among the poor: seemingly forgetting all the rest of the Gospel's evidence. Let us remark that, even now, wherever an apostolic person lives as a poor person among the poor, there are always people, who are better off financially, who recognize him and give him support. By being truly committed to the poor, Jesus saved the rich and won the admiration and friendship of some of them. There was a garden. The place for the executions was an abadoned quarry near the walls of Jerusalem. Tombs were dug along the sides while the bottom was filled and passed as gardens. A rock projected, about four meters high, from the middle of the area. This rock was called Calvary and on it were raised the crosses.</li>

This is an unchanging doctrine of the Church, which is no way attempts to make the creature equal with the Creator. Not without reason has God given us a mother: if it is a misfortune for a child not to have known a mother, it is also a misfortune for a believer when his religion only expresses itself in masculine terms. The believer who welcome Mary to his home as did John is neither a fanatic nor a quibbler regarding faith. There exists a form of humility, joy, interior peace and simple piety characteristic of those Catholics who have known how to open their doors to Mary without throwing out their Savior. Jn 19,28 I am thirsty. Jesus is tortured by thirst. He also thirsts that the Kingdom of his Father be realized in the world. He thirsts for selfless love from those who may share his deepest thoughts and be willing to follow him until Calvary. It is accomplished. Jesus drank the cup of sorrow and humiliation to the las drop. The Father had placed it in his hands as the means for becoming the savior we need. The Work of the Son of God made flesh, which should be nothing less than a new creation of the world, is accomplished. The earthly existence of the son of God comes to an end, and from the sead planted in the earth will come forth the New Creature. The preparatory times of the Jewish religion, in which the Law occupied first place and the fear due to unforgiven sins was never lost, are finished. A stage of history has ended, in which the rest of humanity had been dragged by its fears and acceptance of its deadly fate, which was a form of its slavery to the Evil Spirit. Now begins a new era in history, the era of the new Covenant of God with humanity. The spirit will be communicated to the Church. John said: Jesus gave up the spirit, a word which also indicated that he was giving his Spirit to us. Jn 19,31 THE SACRED HEART In Jesus' death as in his life, there are many details that enable us to understand his sacrifice better, if we see them in the light of the Old Testament. In the piercing of Jesus' heart the words of the prophet Zechariah: They shall look on him whom they pierced (Zec 12:10) were literally fulfilled. The wounds of Jesus are seen by people of any religion as the distintive mark of Christian faith. Without needing words, they tell a way of self-sacrifice in which God made himself a model. God said through Zechariah that this is the moment in which sinners are converted. John also records a prescription of the Law regarding the Passover Lamb: Not one of his bones shall be broken (Ex 12: 46). This occurred at the death of Jesus, the true victim who took the place of the Passover Lamb. Blood and water came out. The Jews believed that only through the blood of their victims could they obtain God's pardon. Speaking poetically, first John, then later the Church, said that from the open breast of Christ came forth the sacrament of baptism and the Eucharist, water and blood. From the cross, forgiveness and new life have sprung forth for us. The open heart of Jeus invites us to discover the powerful, hidden and mysterious love that inspired his life. The disciples of Jesus, who had lived with him, would find that their memories and emotions would be diluted and disappear with time; they would discover, on the other had, that there had been no word, or deed or even silence of Jesus which had not been an expression of his love for God. From his open heart on the cross originates o ur devotion to the Heart of Jesus. Let us not get distracted by intellectual ideas in an attempt to explain or interpret faith; rather, let us comtemplate God's love and allow it to transform us, making us like unto him. Jn 19,38 Jesus has just died and it is two Pharisees who took care of giving him a decent burial. Joseph of Ariathea approached Pilate: because the disciples had no means of approaching the roman governor. Joseph and Nicodemus were disciples in secret. Because Jesus identified himself with the common people, it was difficult for those in better social positions to integrate themselves into his group. Here we have an example of the inevitable consequences of a preferential option for the poor. Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimatheaa, Lazarus and the women mentioned in Luke 8:2 were people of upper or middle class. This fact was enough for some scholars to hastily conclude that Jesus did not live among the poor: seemingly forgetting all the rest of the Gospel's evidence. Let us remark that, even now, wherever an apostolic person lives as a poor person among the poor, there are always people, who are better off financially, who recognize him and give him support. By being truly committed to the poor, Jesus saved the rich and won the admiration and friendship of some of them. There was a garden. The place for the executions was an abadoned quarry near the walls of Jerusalem. Tombs were dug along the sides while the bottom was filled and passed as gardens. A rock projected, about four meters high, from the middle of the area. This rock was called Calvary and on it were raised the crosses.</li>
