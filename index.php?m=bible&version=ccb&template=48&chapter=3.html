<br/>
<p><sup>1</sup><span value="1"><a id="text-ann-1" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-1')" class="annotation"><sup> ① </sup></a>Again Jesus entered the synagogue. A man who had a paralyzed hand was there</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>2</sup><span value="2">and some people watched Jesus: Would he heal the man on the sabbath? If he did they could accuse him.</span></p>
<p><sup>3</sup><span value="3">Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, “Stand here in the center.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>4</sup><span value="4">Then he asked them, “What does the Law allow us to do on the Sabbath? To do good or to do harm? To save life or to kill?” But they were silent.</span></p>
<p><sup>5</sup><span value="5">Then Jesus looked around at them with anger and deep sadness because they had closed their minds. And he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out and his hand was healed.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>6</sup><span value="6">But as soon as the Pharisees left, they met with He rod’s supporters, looking for a way to destroy Jesus.</span></p>
<p><sup>7</sup><span value="7">Jesus and his disciples withdrew to the lakeside and a large crowd from Galilee followed him. A great number of people also came from Judea,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>8</sup><span value="8">Jerusalem, Idumea, Transjordan and from the region of Tyre and Sidon, for they had heard of all that he was doing.</span></p>
<p><sup>9</sup><span value="9">Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to have a boat ready for him, to prevent the people from crushing him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>10</sup><span value="10">He healed so many that all who had diseases kept pressing towards him to touch him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>11</sup><span value="11">Even the people who had evil spirits, when ever they saw him, would fall down before him and cry out, “You are the Son of God.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>12</sup><span value="12">But he warned them sternly not to tell anyone who he was.</span></p>
<h4>The twelve apostles</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>13</sup><span value="13"><a id="text-ann-2" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-2')" class="annotation"><sup> ② </sup></a>Then Jesus went up into the hill country and called those he wanted and they came to him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>14</sup><span value="14">So he appointed twelve to be with him; and he called them apostles. He wanted to send them out to preach,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>15</sup><span value="15">and he gave them authority to drive out demons.</span></p>
<p><sup>16</sup><span value="16">These are the Twelve: Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>17</sup><span value="17">James, son of Zebedee, and John his brother, to whom he gave the name Boanerges, which means “men of thunder”;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>18</sup><span value="18">Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alpheus, Thaddeus, Simon the Cananean</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>19</sup><span value="19">and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed him.</span></p>
<h4>The sin against the Spirit</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>20</sup><span value="20"><a id="text-ann-3" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-3')" class="annotation"><sup> ③ </sup></a>They went home. The crowd began to gather again and they couldn’t even have a meal.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>21</sup><span value="21">Knowing what was happening his relatives came to take charge of him: “He is out of his mind,” they said.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>22</sup><span value="22">Meanwhile, the teachers of the Law who had come from Jerusalem said, “He is in the power of Beelzebul: the chief of the demons helps him to drive out demons.”</span></p>
<p><sup>23</sup><span value="23">Jesus called them to him and began teaching them by means of stories or parables, “How can Satan drive out Satan?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>24</sup><span value="24">If a nation is divided by civil war, that nation cannot stand.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>25</sup><span value="25">If a family divides itself into groups, that family will not survive.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>26</sup><span value="26">In the same way, if Satan has risen against himself and is divided, he will not stand; he is finished.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>27</sup><span value="27">No one can break into the house of the Strong one in order to plunder his goods, unless he first ties up the Strong one. Then indeed, he can plunder his house.</span></p>
<p><sup>28</sup><span value="28">Truly, I say to you, every sin will be forgiven humankind, even insults to God, how ever numerous.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>29</sup><span value="29">But who ever slanders the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven: he carries the guilt of his sin forever.”</span></p>
<p><sup>30</sup><span value="30">This was their sin when they said, “He has an evil spirit in him.”</span></p>
<h4>Jesus’ true family</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>31</sup><span value="31"><a id="text-ann-4" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-4')" class="annotation"><sup> ④ </sup></a>Then his mother and his brothers came. As they stood outside, they sent someone to call him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>32</sup><span value="32">The crowd sitting around Jesus told him, “Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>33</sup><span value="33">He replied, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”</span></p>
<p><sup>34</sup><span value="34">And looking around at those who sat there he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>35</sup><span value="35">Whoever does the will of God is brother and sister and mother to me.”</span></p>
<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Mk 3,1 HUMAN ADVANCEMENT AND THE SABBATH Here, what Mark wants to emphasize is not the miracle Jesus performs, but his attitude vis-u00e0-vis the sabbath. This miracle confirms what he has just said in 2:28. The Pharisees considered it lawful to work on the sabbath if it was a question of saving someone in danger of death. Jesus is about to enlarge this ruling: for him, not to do good is to do evil, not to cure is to kill. Some ask if Jesus was interested in the material advancement (well-being) of people or only in their spiritual progress. Actually, it is impossible to separate one from the other. Jesus, apparently, did not speak of the economy nor the social order, but he did denounce our prejudices which prevent us from giving the world a true and just order. People, then, have the capacity and the means to better their condition, but they use them poorly because they remain prisoners of principles or institutions that are considered sacred, and in order to preserve them they allow half the world to die. Mk 3,13 THE TWELVE It was on the mountain that Moses and Elijah met God: it was there that God gave them their mission (Ex 19; 1 K 19). It is on the mountain that Jesus calls those who will be in a special way associated with his own mission: they will be with him, they will proclaim the Word and drive out demons. Mark tells us here what the Church is: a community assembled by Jesus close to him, where people hear the Word of God and are freed from the slavery of the demon. On the one hand are the countless afflicted who seek relief, and on the other the group of the Twelve whom Jesus asks to be his co-builders in the kingdom of God. What do we know of these twelve who would become Jesus' messengers, the foundations of the Church, the teachers of the faith? The nucleus of the group were fishermen and with them a tax collector, Matthew; a teacher of the Law, Bartholomew; and some others of whom we only know that Jesus chose them from among the people. He came in order to save all, but his work began with the poor. Jesus did not belong more to the poor than to the rich, but like all humans he had to locate himself within a specific environment and social class. Being a son of an artisan, he grew up among simple, humble people. In addition, Jesus made an important decision when he was eighteen or twenty years old. He chose to remain a manual worker rather than to enter a school for teachers of the Law. These religious schools were open to all. Jesus could have begun his preaching as a qualified teacher and would certainly have found his helpers among the sincere teachers of the Law, priests or Pharisees. But no, he preferred to educate himself through the worker's life with no other religious instruction than the teachings of the synagogue, with no other book than the book of life. Because of this, when the time came, he found his apostles among the common people, young men who were simple but reliable people. Mk 3,20 He is in the power of Beelzebul (v. 22). More than the healings, the exorcisms unsettled the Pharisees and the Teachers of the Law. They, the religious authorities, traveled from Jerusalem to see this Jesus for themselves. The Jews of Jesus' time were obsessed with the belief that illness was a form of possession. Jesus does not concern himself with distinguishing between illness and possession. Actually, the Devil is behind all human misery. Beelzebul, the name of an ancient idol, was a Jewish term for the Devil. No one can break into the house of the Strong one. That Strong one is the Devil and his house is the possessed person. To plunder the house is to take away the Devil's power over his victim. Every sin will be forgiven humankind, even insults to God, however numerous and Matthew adds: And the one who speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven (Mt 12:32). Whereas the Old Testament punished blasphemous words with death in order to save God's honor and avoid his anger towards the community, the God whom Jesus knows is aware of how far human stupidity can go and does not feel offended by so many ridiculous or blasphemous words habitually used in our society: he does not defend himself as do the important people of this world. Jesus allows himself to be criticized by those who do not understand him. Many Pharisees of good faith did not understand Jesus and were scandalized by him. This was excusable, but it is a different thing to call evil that which is clearly good. To slander (or: to blaspheme) the Holy Spirit (v. 29) is to attribute to a bad spirit a work that is manifestly good. Those who systematically attribute bad intentions to good work done by others, by the Church, by other parties, sin against the Holy Spirit. The one who recognizes the truth but not God is better off than the one who says he believes in God but does not recognize the truth. About the exorcisms, Jesus concludes: The kingdom of God has come. In reality the victory over Satan is daily reinforced. Our prayer, the insistent prayer of Christian communities, the witness of life and courageous action of Christians are effective in repulsing the diabolical presence of money, the exploitation of others, drugs or the frenzy for sex. Mk 3,31 See Mk 3:20. Jesus lost his relatives but found his true brothers and sisters. When we commit ourselves to God's work, we discover new brothers and sisters and a mother, Mary, of whom the Gospel says, Happy are you for having believed that God's promises would be fulfilled. Jesus does not say He is my father, for the Father is one and he is in Heaven. THE BROTHERS OF JESUS The Church never doubted that Mary was a virgin and that Jesus was her only son, as he is the only son of the Father (see commentary on Lk 1:26). Why then does it speak of Jesus' brothers and sisters? First, in Hebrew, any relative is called brother or sister. In the Bible we find more than five hundred examples where the word brother signifies a fairly close relationship. To avoid confusion the Jews used some clearer forms. If the Gospel really meant brothers - sons of Mary - on mentioning them together with her, it should have said, Your mother and the sons of your mother are here. This was the only acceptable way of expressing it at that time. Some people say: If the word 'brother' often denotes distant cousins, it may also mean brothers in the strict sense of the word. Let us look more closely to see who are the brothers of Jesus. They are mentioned at the time Jesus visits Nazareth: James and Joset (Matthew says Joseph), Jude and Simon. Among the women at the foot of the cross, Mark mentions a certain mother of James the less and of Joset. If it were Mary, mother of Jesus, it would be very strange that precisely at this hour she is spoken of as the mother of James and Joset rather than as mother of the condemned. It would also be strange that she is mentioned only after Mary of Magdala. John says that this Mary, wife of Cleophas, was the sister, which means probably a close relative, of Mary (Jn 19:25). We must then admit that James and Joset are the sons of this other Mary (Mt 28:1) who was one of the group of women who came from Galilee with Jesus (Lk 23:55). They are at the most first cousins of Jesus, while Simon and Jude were more distant cousins. James and Joset would not be mentioned before Simon and Jude if they were more distant relatives of Jesus. Also, in the first Christian community, when the Gospels were written, there was a very influential group composed of Jesus' relatives and townmates of Nazareth. These were called brothers of the Lord and one of them, James, became bishop of the Jerusalem community. Little is said of this group other than that they were late in believing in Jesus even though he had lived with them for several years (Mk 3:21; Jn 7:3-5). In referring to them, the Gospel gives them the name the Christian community had given them, brothers of the Lord or so and so, brother of Jesus.</li>

If it were Mary, mother of Jesus, it would be very strange that precisely at this hour she is spoken of as the mother of James and Joset rather than as mother of the condemned. It would also be strange that she is mentioned only after Mary of Magdala. John says that this Mary, wife of Cleophas, was the sister, which means probably a close relative, of Mary (Jn 19:25). We must then admit that James and Joset are the sons of this other Mary (Mt 28:1) who was one of the group of women who came from Galilee with Jesus (Lk 23:55). They are at the most first cousins of Jesus, while Simon and Jude were more distant cousins. James and Joset would not be mentioned before Simon and Jude if they were more distant relatives of Jesus. Also, in the first Christian community, when the Gospels were written, there was a very influential group composed of Jesus' relatives and townmates of Nazareth. These were called brothers of the Lord and one of them, James, became bishop of the Jerusalem community. Little is said of this group other than that they were late in believing in Jesus even though he had lived with them for several years (Mk 3:21; Jn 7:3-5). In referring to them, the Gospel gives them the name the Christian community had given them, brothers of the Lord or so and so, brother of Jesus.</li>
<li id="annotation-4">Mk 3,1 HUMAN ADVANCEMENT AND THE SABBATH Here, what Mark wants to emphasize is not the miracle Jesus performs, but his attitude vis-u00e0-vis the sabbath. This miracle confirms what he has just said in 2:28. The Pharisees considered it lawful to work on the sabbath if it was a question of saving someone in danger of death. Jesus is about to enlarge this ruling: for him, not to do good is to do evil, not to cure is to kill. Some ask if Jesus was interested in the material advancement (well-being) of people or only in their spiritual progress. Actually, it is impossible to separate one from the other. Jesus, apparently, did not speak of the economy nor the social order, but he did denounce our prejudices which prevent us from giving the world a true and just order. People, then, have the capacity and the means to better their condition, but they use them poorly because they remain prisoners of principles or institutions that are considered sacred, and in order to preserve them they allow half the world to die. Mk 3,13 THE TWELVE It was on the mountain that Moses and Elijah met God: it was there that God gave them their mission (Ex 19; 1 K 19). It is on the mountain that Jesus calls those who will be in a special way associated with his own mission: they will be with him, they will proclaim the Word and drive out demons. Mark tells us here what the Church is: a community assembled by Jesus close to him, where people hear the Word of God and are freed from the slavery of the demon. On the one hand are the countless afflicted who seek relief, and on the other the group of the Twelve whom Jesus asks to be his co-builders in the kingdom of God. What do we know of these twelve who would become Jesus' messengers, the foundations of the Church, the teachers of the faith? The nucleus of the group were fishermen and with them a tax collector, Matthew; a teacher of the Law, Bartholomew; and some others of whom we only know that Jesus chose them from among the people. He came in order to save all, but his work began with the poor. Jesus did not belong more to the poor than to the rich, but like all humans he had to locate himself within a specific environment and social class. Being a son of an artisan, he grew up among simple, humble people. In addition, Jesus made an important decision when he was eighteen or twenty years old. He chose to remain a manual worker rather than to enter a school for teachers of the Law. These religious schools were open to all. Jesus could have begun his preaching as a qualified teacher and would certainly have found his helpers among the sincere teachers of the Law, priests or Pharisees. But no, he preferred to educate himself through the worker's life with no other religious instruction than the teachings of the synagogue, with no other book than the book of life. Because of this, when the time came, he found his apostles among the common people, young men who were simple but reliable people. Mk 3,20 He is in the power of Beelzebul (v. 22). More than the healings, the exorcisms unsettled the Pharisees and the Teachers of the Law. They, the religious authorities, traveled from Jerusalem to see this Jesus for themselves. The Jews of Jesus' time were obsessed with the belief that illness was a form of possession. Jesus does not concern himself with distinguishing between illness and possession. Actually, the Devil is behind all human misery. Beelzebul, the name of an ancient idol, was a Jewish term for the Devil. No one can break into the house of the Strong one. That Strong one is the Devil and his house is the possessed person. To plunder the house is to take away the Devil's power over his victim. Every sin will be forgiven humankind, even insults to God, however numerous and Matthew adds: And the one who speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven (Mt 12:32). Whereas the Old Testament punished blasphemous words with death in order to save God's honor and avoid his anger towards the community, the God whom Jesus knows is aware of how far human stupidity can go and does not feel offended by so many ridiculous or blasphemous words habitually used in our society: he does not defend himself as do the important people of this world. Jesus allows himself to be criticized by those who do not understand him. Many Pharisees of good faith did not understand Jesus and were scandalized by him. This was excusable, but it is a different thing to call evil that which is clearly good. To slander (or: to blaspheme) the Holy Spirit (v. 29) is to attribute to a bad spirit a work that is manifestly good. Those who systematically attribute bad intentions to good work done by others, by the Church, by other parties, sin against the Holy Spirit. The one who recognizes the truth but not God is better off than the one who says he believes in God but does not recognize the truth. About the exorcisms, Jesus concludes: The kingdom of God has come. In reality the victory over Satan is daily reinforced. Our prayer, the insistent prayer of Christian communities, the witness of life and courageous action of Christians are effective in repulsing the diabolical presence of money, the exploitation of others, drugs or the frenzy for sex. Mk 3,31 See Mk 3:20. Jesus lost his relatives but found his true brothers and sisters. When we commit ourselves to God's work, we discover new brothers and sisters and a mother, Mary, of whom the Gospel says, Happy are you for having believed that God's promises would be fulfilled. Jesus does not say He is my father, for the Father is one and he is in Heaven. THE BROTHERS OF JESUS The Church never doubted that Mary was a virgin and that Jesus was her only son, as he is the only son of the Father (see commentary on Lk 1:26). Why then does it speak of Jesus' brothers and sisters? First, in Hebrew, any relative is called brother or sister. In the Bible we find more than five hundred examples where the word brother signifies a fairly close relationship. To avoid confusion the Jews used some clearer forms. If the Gospel really meant brothers - sons of Mary - on mentioning them together with her, it should have said, Your mother and the sons of your mother are here. This was the only acceptable way of expressing it at that time. Some people say: If the word 'brother' often denotes distant cousins, it may also mean brothers in the strict sense of the word. Let us look more closely to see who are the brothers of Jesus. They are mentioned at the time Jesus visits Nazareth: James and Joset (Matthew says Joseph), Jude and Simon. Among the women at the foot of the cross, Mark mentions a certain mother of James the less and of Joset. If it were Mary, mother of Jesus, it would be very strange that precisely at this hour she is spoken of as the mother of James and Joset rather than as mother of the condemned. It would also be strange that she is mentioned only after Mary of Magdala. John says that this Mary, wife of Cleophas, was the sister, which means probably a close relative, of Mary (Jn 19:25). We must then admit that James and Joset are the sons of this other Mary (Mt 28:1) who was one of the group of women who came from Galilee with Jesus (Lk 23:55). They are at the most first cousins of Jesus, while Simon and Jude were more distant cousins. James and Joset would not be mentioned before Simon and Jude if they were more distant relatives of Jesus. Also, in the first Christian community, when the Gospels were written, there was a very influential group composed of Jesus' relatives and townmates of Nazareth. These were called brothers of the Lord and one of them, James, became bishop of the Jerusalem community. Little is said of this group other than that they were late in believing in Jesus even though he had lived with them for several years (Mk 3:21; Jn 7:3-5).
