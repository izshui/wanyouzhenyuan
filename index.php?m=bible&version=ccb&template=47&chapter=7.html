<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Mt 7,1 No doubt when Jesus spoke these words it was with the same meaning as in 5:43. Usually those who consider themselves as good, or belonging to the group of the converted, judge and criticize those of a different standing. It is a form of pride that spiritual authors call the fault of beginners. So strongly inscribed is it in human nature that many among the just of the Bible have expressed their disapproval of the sinner who did not observe the law of God. Contrariwise the new law tells us not to consider ourselves superior or be judges of those who take a different road, or who are led by God to do so. Do not judge. We must exercise good judgment in order to distinguish between the good and evil around us. Though it is a factor of success never to displease anyone, we must have the courage to tell others the wrong that they do. Here to judge means to condemn. When we look at our own lives, we realize that those who helped us grow were those who supported and understood us, not those who judged and condemned us. Do not judge. See Rom 2:1; 14:4; 1 Cor 5:12; Jas 4:11. Mt 7,6 Do not give what is holy to the dogs, or throw your pearls to pigs. Jesus addressed this warning to his followers living in a hostile world. They should not tell everything to everyone. God has given each of us wonderful gifts: we must not share them with everyone at once, believing that it will bring them to faith. Mt 7,7 See commentary on Luke 11:9; Mark 11:24; John 14:13; 15:7; Jas 1:5. Mt 7,13 Enter through the narrow gate. Maybe someone was asking Jesus: Who will be saved? (Mt 19:25). In no instance did Jesus say whether those who would share in eternal life would be many or few. He did say many times that very few would be chosen from among the many called. That means that among the many people privileged to meet him, very few would experience the Gospel's riches and bring forth fruit in themselves and for others. The chosen or approved are those who persevere and strive for perfect freedom. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many go that way. They stray from leading a life in which Jesus is everything for them. They waste the gifts of God entrusted to them and apparently become useless for the Kingdom. Yet, even so, they are not deprived of God's mercy. Not all will be lost. Mt 7,15 Most probably Matthew gives us these words of Jesus for the benefit of certain believers in the early Church who considered themselves as charismatic prophets. They may well have received gifts of the Spirit but have degenerated since then. In a wider sense Jesus' words address all who encourage division, untruth and violence, even when they pretend to serve a just cause. Prophets wore a sheepskin by way of a cloak: a wolf could hide in one. The world has always had a number of false prophets, usually prophets of easy life, and if the Word of God condemns them, many will say that word has been misinterpreted. It would be well however to ask ourselves why our holy and sacred liberalism tends to sow death in all domains and smothers in so many the ability to believe and hope. Do you ever pick grapes from thornbushes? Jesus invites us to look at the facts before coming to conclusions. We find it hard to carefully observe the reality in which we live. We prefer to discuss and debate about ideas rather than to analyze particular situations. Jesus, accustomed to manual labor, distrusts ideas and theories. Mt 7,21 Many will say to me on that day. Matthew probably quotes this sentence pointing out to the charismatic prophets who disturb his communities by not obeying precepts which are addressed to everyone. Whether we teach or work miracles, these abilities and ministries given us for the good of the community do not assure us that we are in the grace of God. True faith works through love (Gal 5:6) and moves us to fulfill all the Law: Jas 2:8. Anyone who hears these words of mine (v. 24). Jesus means those who listen to his words and are converted: they believe themselves already saved. If they do not use their initial enthusiasm to build their lives on solid foundations, such as scriptural meditation, generosity, resistance to evil inclinations, sharing in the Christian community - then everything will tumble down later. Mt 7,28 With this paragraph Matthew closes the first Discourse wherein he gathers words of Jesus that might serve as a call to all people of good will. A new Discourse will begin in chapter 10.</li>

See Rom 2:1; 14:4; 1 Cor 5:12; Jas 4:11. Mt 7,6 Do not give what is holy to the dogs, or throw your pearls to pigs. Jesus addressed this warning to his followers living in a hostile world. They should not tell everything to everyone. God has given each of us wonderful gifts: we must not share them with everyone at once, believing that it will bring them to faith. Mt 7,7 See commentary on Luke 11:9; Mark 11:24; John 14:13; 15:7; Jas 1:5. Mt 7,13 Enter through the narrow gate. Maybe someone was asking Jesus: Who will be saved? (Mt 19:25). In no instance did Jesus say whether those who would share in eternal life would be many or few. He did say many times that very few would be chosen from among the many called. That means that among the many people privileged to meet him, very few would experience the Gospel's riches and bring forth fruit in themselves and for others. The chosen or approved are those who persevere and strive for perfect freedom. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many go that way. They stray from leading a life in which Jesus is everything for them. They waste the gifts of God entrusted to them and apparently become useless for the Kingdom. Yet, even so, they are not deprived of God's mercy. Not all will be lost. Mt 7,15 Most probably Matthew gives us these words of Jesus for the benefit of certain believers in the early Church who considered themselves as charismatic prophets. They may well have received gifts of the Spirit but have degenerated since then. In a wider sense Jesus' words address all who encourage division, untruth and violence, even when they pretend to serve a just cause. Prophets wore a sheepskin by way of a cloak: a wolf could hide in one. The world has always had a number of false prophets, usually prophets of easy life, and if the Word of God condemns them, many will say that word has been misinterpreted. It would be well however to ask ourselves why our holy and sacred liberalism tends to sow death in all domains and smothers in so many the ability to believe and hope. Do you ever pick grapes from thornbushes? Jesus invites us to look at the facts before coming to conclusions. We find it hard to carefully observe the reality in which we live. We prefer to discuss and debate about ideas rather than to analyze particular situations. Jesus, accustomed to manual labor, distrusts ideas and theories. Mt 7,21 Many will say to me on that day. Matthew probably quotes this sentence pointing out to the charismatic prophets who disturb his communities by not obeying precepts which are addressed to everyone. Whether we teach or work miracles, these abilities and ministries given us for the good of the community do not assure us that we are in the grace of God. True faith works through love (Gal 5:6) and moves us to fulfill all the Law: Jas 2:8. Anyone who hears these words of mine (v. 24). Jesus means those who listen to his words and are converted: they believe themselves already saved. If they do not use their initial enthusiasm to build their lives on solid foundations, such as scriptural meditation, generosity, resistance to evil inclinations, sharing in the Christian community - then everything will tumble down later. Mt 7,28 With this paragraph Matthew closes the first Discourse wherein he gathers words of Jesus that might serve as a call to all people of good will. A new Discourse will begin in chapter 10.</li>
<li id="annotation-6">Mt 7,1 No doubt when Jesus spoke these words it was with the same meaning as in 5:43. Usually those who consider themselves as good, or belonging to the group of the converted, judge and criticize those of a different standing. It is a form of pride that spiritual authors call the fault of beginners. So strongly inscribed is it in human nature that many among the just of the Bible have expressed their disapproval of the sinner who did not observe the law of God. Contrariwise the new law tells us not to consider ourselves superior or be judges of those who take a different road, or who are led by God to do so. Do not judge. We must exercise good judgment in order to distinguish between the good and evil around us. Though it is a factor of success never to displease anyone, we must have the courage to tell others the wrong that they do. Here to judge means to condemn.
