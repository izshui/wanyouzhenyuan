This was the beginning of a great persecution against the Church in Jerusalem. All, except the apostles, were scattered throughout the region of Judea and Samaria.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>2</sup><span value="2">Devout men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>3</sup><span value="3">Saul meanwhile was trying to destroy the Church; he entered house after house and dragged off men and women and had them put in jail.</span></p>
<h4>Philip proclaims the word in Samaria</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>4</sup><span value="4"><a id="text-ann-2" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-2')" class="annotation"><sup> ② </sup></a>At the same time those who were scattered went about preaching the word.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>5</sup><span value="5">Philip went down to a town of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>6</sup><span value="6">All the people paid close attention to what Philip said as they listened to him and saw the miraculous signs that he did.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>7</sup><span value="7">For in cases of possession, the unclean spirits came out shrieking loudly. Many people who were paralyzed or crippled were healed.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>8</sup><span value="8">So there was great joy in that town.</span></p>
<h4>Simon the magician</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>9</sup><span value="9"><a id="text-ann-3" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-3')" class="annotation"><sup> ③ </sup></a>A certain man named Simon had come to this town, practicing magic. He held the Samaritans spellbound and passed himself off as a very important person.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>10</sup><span value="10">All the people, from the last to the greatest, put their trust in him, saying, “This is the Power of God, the Great One.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>11</sup><span value="11">And they followed him because he had held them under the spell of his magic for a long time.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>12</sup><span value="12">But when they came to believe Philip who announced to them the Kingdom of God and Jesus Christ as Savior, both men and women were baptized.</span></p>
<p><sup>13</sup><span value="13">Simon himself believed and was baptized, and would not depart from Philip. He was astonished when he saw the miraculous signs and wonders that happened.</span></p>
<p><sup>14</sup><span value="14">Now, when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>15</sup><span value="15">They went down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>16</sup><span value="16">for he had not as yet come down upon any of them since they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>17</sup><span value="17">So Peter and John laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.</span></p>
<p><sup>18</sup><span value="18">When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>19</sup><span value="19">saying, “Give me also this power, so that anyone upon whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”</span></p>
<p><sup>20</sup><span value="20">Peter replied, “May you and your money perish for thinking that the Gift of God could be bought with money!</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>21</sup><span value="21">You cannot share in this since you do not understand the things of God.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>22</sup><span value="22">Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours and pray to the Lord that you may be forgiven such a wrong way of thinking;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>23</sup><span value="23">I see you are poisoned with bitterness and in the grip of sin.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>24</sup><span value="24">Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me yourselves, so that none of these things you spoke of will happen to me.”</span></p>
<p><sup>25</sup><span value="25">Peter and John gave their testimony and spoke the word of the Lord. And they went back to Jerusalem, bringing the Good News to many Samaritan villages along the way.</span></p>
<h4>Philip baptizes the Ethiopian</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>26</sup><span value="26"><a id="text-ann-4" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-4')" class="annotation"><sup> ④ </sup></a>An angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Go south towards the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, the desert road.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>27</sup><span value="27">So he set out and it happened that an Ethiopian was passing along that way. He was an official in charge of the treasury of the queen of the Ethiopians; he had come on pilgrimage to Jerusalem</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>28</sup><span value="28">and was on his way home. He was sitting in his carriage and reading the prophet Isaiah.</span></p>
<p><sup>29</sup><span value="29">The Spirit said to Philip, “Go and catch up with that carriage.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>30</sup><span value="30">So Philip ran up and heard the man reading the prophet Isaiah; and he asked, “Do you really understand what you are reading?” The Ethiopian replied,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>31</sup><span value="31">“How can I, unless someone explains it to me?” He then invited Philip to get in and sit beside him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>32</sup><span value="32">This was the passage of Scripture he was reading: He was led like a sheep to be slaughtered; like a lamb that is dumb before the shearer, he did not open his mouth.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>33</sup><span value="33">He was humbled and deprived of his rights. Who can speak of his descendants? For he was uprooted from the earth.</span></p>
<p><sup>34</sup><span value="34">The official asked Philip, “Tell me, please, does the prophet speak of himself or of someone else?”</span></p>
<p><sup>35</sup><span value="35">Then Philip began to tell him the Good News of Jesus, using this text of Scripture as his starting point.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>36</sup><span value="36">As they traveled down the road they came to a place where there was some water. Then the Ethiopian official said, “Look, here is water; what is to keep me from being baptized?” (</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>37</sup><span value="37">)</span></p>
<p><sup>38</sup><span value="38">Then he ordered the carriage to stop; both Philip and the Ethiopian went down into the water and Philip baptized him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>39</sup><span value="39">When they came out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away. The Ethiopian saw him no more, but he continued on his way full of joy.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>40</sup><span value="40">Philip found himself at Azotus, and he went about announcing the Good News in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.</span></p>
<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Acts 8,1 The death of Stephen leads to a resurrection. Instead of Stephen, the Church will have a new apostle in Saul who, after his conversion, will become St Paul. So God heard the prayer of Stephen for his murderers. The illegal execution of Stephen unleashes the persecution against the Hellenist Christians. The apostles and others in the Hebrew group were not persecuted, because they were considered loyal to the Jewish religion and traditions. Concerning Saul's attitude, see what he himself will say later in Galatians 1:13. Acts 8,4 The persecuted Christians proclaim their faith and start Christian communities in Samaria. Evangelization brings happiness: God reveals himself, and through his Spirit he heals bodies and hearts. God becomes present. What a marvelous and moving thing! Joy, rather than fear and sectarianism, will always surround authentic Christians. Acts 8,9 Who is the most important person in this passage? Simon? No: it is the Holy Spirit. Philip is one of the seven. He baptizes but he cannot communicate the gifts of the Spirit. Baptism and the laying on of hands are the two stages of Christian initiation; they refer to two different aspects of life in the church. Baptism is the renewal of the individual through faith. While, the laying on of hands expresses the transmission of the Spirit in an uninterrupted way, beginning with those who received it at Pentecost. This laying of hands (which has become confirmation in today's Church) was then usually followed by these manifestations we read of in the Acts (19:6) and in Paul (1 Cor 12 and 14). The spectacular aspect of these gifts is often what impresses us most; they were part of a global experience which is still given in one way or another to those who have surrendered to the Spirit. Simon, a magician, quack or hypnotist, gave Peter the opportunity to condemn a false understanding of spiritual gifts. Simon thought the apostles were more powerful magicians than he was, and wanted to buy the power of working certain miracles. Peter gives us to understand that looking for miracles is clearly not the way to prepare for receiving the Spirit. In any case, such things are not bought. The manifestations of the Spirit are not always like the ones mentioned in Acts (see Acts 19:6 and 1 Cor 12). This is because God adapts his gifts to the needs of the Church. Communities of simple, poor people are those that receive more gifts of healing for the sick. Because they lack normal resources, God becomes present. Prayer groups receive the gift of tongues, which is one of the gifts that strengthens piety. The gift of prophecy manifests itself in various ways according to context. Where faith leans heavily on the certainty of divine justice and the fear of God, we see predictions and revelations of the secrets of the heart. Whereas, among those with a more rational and intellectual bent, the prophet is often characterized by the gift of speaking with assurance and the ability to stress a point in such a way that the community or individuals recognize the voice of God. The Spirit continues to be at work in many believers who, perhaps, neither speak in tongues nor work healings, but act under the inspiration of the Spirit. They produce the 'fruits of the Spirit' (Gal 5:22-24) and are thus authentic witnesses of Jesus. Baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus (v. 16). See the note on 19:5 on that subject. Acts 8,26 Note how the Holy Spirit leads Philip towards a man who was neither a Jew nor a Samaritan, the first person of another race to receive the Gospel. The Ethiopian who is baptized is simply a man who 'fears the Lord.' This is the way they referred to people of other races who were attracted to the religion of the Jews and to faith in the one God. Without following all the Jewish customs, they read the Bible and liked to take part in the Jewish ceremonies. The conversation with Philip begins on the basis of a text from Isaiah 53:7. This poem, called Servant of the Lord, speaks of a just man unjustly condemned who, through his sufferings, atones for the sins of all humankind. In this text the apostles saw one of the passages which best prefigured Christ: see commentary on Mark 14:24 and 1 Peter 2:24-25. Isaiah's poem concludes with a veiled reference to the resurrection of the Servant of the Lord.
