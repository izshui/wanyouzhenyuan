                                                        <h4>Jesus sends the Twelve on a mission</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>1</sup><span value="1">Then Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them power and authority to drive out all evil spirits and to heal diseases.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>2</sup><span value="2">And he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>3</sup><span value="3">He instructed them, “Don’t take anything for the journey, neither walking stick, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver coins; and don’t even take a spare tunic.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>4</sup><span value="4">Whatever house you enter, remain there until you leave that place.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>5</sup><span value="5">And wherever they don’t welcome you, leave the town and shake the dust from your feet: it will be as a testimony against them.”</span></p>
<p><sup>6</sup><span value="6">So they set out and went through the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.</span></p>
<p><sup>7</sup><span value="7">King Herod heard of all this and did not know what to think, for people said, “This is John, raised from the dead.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>8</sup><span value="8">Others believed that Elijah or one of the ancient prophets had come back to life.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>9</sup><span value="9">As for Herod, he said, “I had John beheaded; who is this man about whom I hear such wonders?” And he was anxious to see him.</span></p>
<p><sup>10</sup><span value="10">On their return the apostles told Jesus everything they had done. Then he took them aside to a lonely place, and they went away to a town called Bethsaida to be by themselves.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>11</sup><span value="11">But the crowd heard of this and caught up with him. So he welcomed them and began speaking about the kingdom of God, curing those who needed healing.</span></p>
<h4>Miracle of the loaves</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>12</sup><span value="12"><a id="text-ann-1" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-1')" class="annotation"><sup> ① </sup></a>The day was drawing to a close and the Twelve drew near to tell him, “Send the crowd away and let them go into the villages and farms around, to find lodging and food, for we are here in a lonely place.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>13</sup><span value="13">But Jesus replied, “You yourselves give them something to eat.” They answered, “We have only five loaves and two fish; do you want us to go and buy food enough for all this crowd?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>14</sup><span value="14">For there were about five thousand men. Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Make people sit down in groups of fifties.”</span></p>
<p><sup>15</sup><span value="15">So they made all of them settle down.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>16</sup><span value="16">Jesus then took the five loaves and two fish, and raising his eyes to heaven, pronounced a blessing over them; he broke them and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the crowd.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>17</sup><span value="17">They ate and everyone had enough; and when they gathered up what was left, twelve baskets were filled with broken pieces.</span></p>
<h4>Peter’s profession of faith</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>18</sup><span value="18"><a id="text-ann-2" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-2')" class="annotation"><sup> ② </sup></a>One day when Jesus was praying alone, not far from his disciples, he asked them, “What do people say about me?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>19</sup><span value="19">And they answered, “Some say that you are John the Baptist; others say that you are Elijah, and still others that you are one of the former prophets risen from the dead.” Again Jesus asked them,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>20</sup><span value="20">“Who then do you say I am?” Peter answered, “The Messiah of God.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>21</sup><span value="21">Then Jesus spoke to them, giving them strict orders not to tell this to anyone.</span></p>
<p><sup>22</sup><span value="22"><a id="text-ann-3" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-3')" class="annotation"><sup> ③ </sup></a>And he added, “The Son of Man must suffer many things. He will be rejected by the elders and chief priests and teachers of the Law, and put to death. Then after three days he will be raised to life.”</span></p>
<p><sup>23</sup><span value="23">Jesus also said to all the people, “If you wish to be a follower of mine, deny yourself and take up your cross each day, and follow me.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>24</sup><span value="24">For if you choose to save your life, you will lose it, and if you lose your life for my sake, you will save it.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>25</sup><span value="25">What does it profit you to gain the whole world while you destroy or damage yourself?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>26</sup><span value="26">If someone feels ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Glory and in the Glory of his Father with his holy angels.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>27</sup><span value="27">Truly, I say to you, there are some here who will not experience death before they see the kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<h4>The transfiguration</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>28</sup><span value="28"><a id="text-ann-4" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-4')" class="annotation"><sup> ④ </sup></a>About eight days after Jesus had said all this, he took Peter, John and James and went up the mountain to pray.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>29</sup><span value="29">And while he was praying, the aspect of his face was changed and his clothing became dazzling white.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>30</sup><span value="30">Two men were talking with Jesus: Moses and Elijah.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>31</sup><span value="31">They had just appeared in heavenly glory and were telling him about his departure that had to take place in Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><sup>32</sup><span value="32">Peter and his companions had fallen asleep, but they awoke suddenly and saw Jesus’ Glory and the two men standing with him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>33</sup><span value="33">As Moses and Elijah were about to leave, Peter said to him, “Master, how good it is for us to be here for we can make three tents, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” For Peter didn’t know what to say.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>34</sup><span value="34">And no sooner had he spoken than a cloud appeared and covered them; and the disciples were afraid as they entered the cloud.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>35</sup><span value="35">Then these words came from the cloud, “This is my Son, my Chosen one, listen to him.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>36</sup><span value="36">And after the voice had spoken, Jesus was there alone. The disciples kept this to themselves at the time, telling no one of anything they had seen.</span></p>
<h4>The epileptic demoniac</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>37</sup><span value="37">The next day, when they came down from the mountain, quite a group met Jesus.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>38</sup><span value="38">A man among them called out, “Master, I beg you to look at my son, my only child. When the evil spirit seizes him, he suddenly screams.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>39</sup><span value="39">The spirit throws him into a fit and he foams at the mouth; it scarcely ever leaves him after wearing him out.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>40</sup><span value="40">I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.”</span></p>
<p><sup>41</sup><span value="41">Jesus answered, “You faithless people! How wrong you are! How long must I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>42</sup><span value="42">And while the boy was being brought, the demon knocked him to the ground and threw him into a fit. But Jesus spoke sharply to the evil spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</span></p>
<p><sup>43</sup><span value="43">And all who saw it were astonished at God’s wonderful work. While all were amazed at everything Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>44</sup><span value="44">“Listen and remember what I tell you now: The Son of Man will be delivered into human hands.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>45</sup><span value="45">But the disciples didn’t understand this saying; something prevented them from grasping what he meant, and they were afraid to ask him about it.</span></p>
<h4>Who is the greatest?</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>46</sup><span value="46"><a id="text-ann-5" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-5')" class="annotation"><sup> ⑤ </sup></a>One day the disciples were arguing about which of them was the most important.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>47</sup><span value="47">But Jesus knew their thoughts, so he took a little child and stood him by his side.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>48</sup><span value="48">Then he said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me, welcomes the one who sent me. And listen: the one who is found to be the least among you all, is the one who is the greatest.”</span></p>
<p><sup>49</sup><span value="49">Then John spoke up, “Master, we saw someone who drove out demons by calling upon your name, and we tried to forbid him because he doesn’t follow you with us.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>50</sup><span value="50">But Jesus said, “Don’t forbid him. He who is not against you is for you.”</span></p>
<h4>Jesus unwelcome in a Samaritan village</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>51</sup><span value="51"><a id="text-ann-6" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-6')" class="annotation"><sup> ⑥ </sup></a>As the time drew near when Jesus would be taken up to heaven, he made up his mind to go to Jerusalem.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>52</sup><span value="52">He had sent ahead of him some messengers who entered a Samaritan village to prepare a lodging for him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>53</sup><span value="53">But the people would not receive him because he was on his way to Jerusalem.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>54</sup><span value="54">Seeing this, James and John, his disciples said, “Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to reduce them to ashes?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>55</sup><span value="55">Jesus turned and rebuked them,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>56</sup><span value="56">and they went on to another village.</span></p>
<h4>The cost of following Jesus</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>57</sup><span value="57"><a id="text-ann-7" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-7')" class="annotation"><sup> ⑦ </sup></a>As they went on their way, a man said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>58</sup><span value="58">Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”</span></p>
<p><sup>59</sup><span value="59">To another Jesus said, “Follow me.” But he answered, “Let me go back now, for first I want to bury my father.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>60</sup><span value="60">And Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their dead; as for you, leave them and proclaim the kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<p><sup>61</sup><span value="61">Another said to him, “I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say goodbye to my family.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>62</sup><span value="62">And Jesus said to him, “Whoever has put his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Lk 9,12 See commentary on Mark 6:35. This multiplication of the loaves occurs in all four Gospels, which is true of very few events in the Gospel. Besides this account, another multiplication of the loaves is related in Matthew 15:32 and Mark 8:1. It is likely due to the fact that one could see in it the announcement of the eucharist as will be emphasized in the Gospel of John (ch. 6). This abundance of accounts may be due to the fact that the multiplication of bread is one of the miracles of Jesus which best shows his absolute power over the laws of nature (see commentary on Mark 8:1). Remember that the Jews of Jesus' time were a poor people, too numerous for a fertile, but limited territory. The Roman occupants claimed a good portion of the resources, and politicians like Herod imposed heavy taxes, which were partly justified by the need to occupy the extra manpower in grandiose projects. Many people had no security in employment, as is true today in many countries, and Jesus along with his followers shared that situation. In that desolate area, Jesus felt responsible for all his brothers and sisters who became his guests (as also happens in Luke 11:5), and he acted according to faith. Every day, in those times until now, many people must have shared their last resources with someone poorer, confident that God would pay them back. Jesus, in turn, would do no less. The miracle he performed at that moment confirms the faith of many humble believers, who are perhaps not too devoted to the Church, but who often know how to risk all they have. Jesus is not concerned that this miracle awakens in them a misguided enthusiasm which will end up with a split among his followers (see Mk 6:45). Jesus had not fed them to attract them to his church, but to fulfill God's promises to the poor. Lk 9,18 This occurred near Caesarea Philippi, a famous spa located in the far north of Palestine, at the foot of Mount Hermon. Jesus had gone away from Galilee because he was not safe there. As was his custom, he sent the Twelve ahead of him to the villages he would visit, to prepare for his coming. What do people say about me? And you, what did you tell them about me when you were among them? Who did you tell them I was? Peter answers first, confident that they were not wrong in presenting their teacher as the Messiah, the One sent by God. Jesus does not deny that he is, but he forbids them to make it known from then on, because, according to the people, the Liberator had to crush his enemies. Can the apostles simply call Liberator, one who will die on a cross? By comparing this text with Mk 8:27 and Mt 16:13, we come to the following conclusion: Matthew combined in a single story two different events in which Peter was first in proclaiming his faith. The first episode is the one which Luke relates at this point. In the second, Peter recognized Jesus as the Son of God and received the promise which Matthew recalls. Perhaps this took place after the multiplication of the loaves: compare with John 6:66-69, or perhaps after the Resurrection: compare with John 21:15-17, which insists not on faith, but on the love that Jesus can see in Peter. See also Galatians 2:7-8. Lk 9,22 Why did Jesus ask his apostles the questions we have just read? the Gospel answers clearly: because the time had come for Jesus to announce his passion to them. Jesus had not only come to teach people but to open for them the door leading to the Resurrection. Since his apostles now know him to be the Savior promised to Israel, they must learn that there is no salvation if death is not conquered (1 Cor 15:25). Jesus will obtain this victory when he freely chooses the way of the cross: the Son of Man has to suffer much and be rejected by the authorities. Immediately after that, Jesus adds that we must all share in his victory over death: You must deny your self: this is the fundamental orientation of our life. We must choose between serving and being served, sacrificing ourselves for others or taking advantage of them. Or, as a well-known prayer puts it: Let me seek not so much to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love. It is in his early years that a child is helped towards this choice. In a true family he is not the center and king, with his parents as slaves, but he learns how to serve and give himself. He must accept his brothers and sisters, share with them and at times limit his own future for their good. Take up your cross each day (v. 33). Here comes the acceptance of the cross which the Lord gives to each one of us and which we do not have to choose because we find it in our destiny. We must not carry it because we are compelled to, but rather we must love it because the Lord wished it for us. In a world where it has become usual to live one's own life - and in so doing, to waste it, many difficult, even abnormal children, will cause their parents to become true followers of Jesus in bearing their cross. If you choose to save your life (v. 24). Jesus refers to the general orientation of our life. He has nothing in common with those who are only concerned about avoiding sins, while they pursue their ambitions and their desire to enjoy this life to the fullest. The mere fact of seeking to live without risks separates us from God's way. If someone feels ashamed of me (v. 26). Besides the cross given to us each day, God will ask us to witness to our faith and in that we will have to run risks, even if it is nothing more than the risk of being ridiculed by our friends and our boss. During periods of violence, can Christians remain silent, limit themselves to their spiritual reunions, give no concrete indication of what they themselves think and live? Lk 9,28 Recall the divine revelation Jesus received at the beginning of his ministry (Lk 3:21). This other divine manifestation Jesus receives at the Transfiguration is due to the beginning of a new stage: the Passion. Jesus has already been preaching for two years, but there is no hope that Israel will overcome the violence which will lead to its ruin. Even if Jesus' miracles do not convince his compatriots, Jesus will have to face the forces of evil: his sacrifice will be more effective than his words in arousing love and the spirit of sacrifice in all the people who will continue his saving work in the future. He took Peter, James and John with him: these men had a privileged place among the Twelve (Mk 1:29; 3:16; 5:37; 10:35; 13:3). Most probably the rest of the apostles only reacted very slowly. All the patience and pedagogy of Jesus did not make them grow more quickly and they were not ready to enter the cloud with him. He went up into the mountain to pray. It is quite possible that it was during a night of prayer that the event that Jesus expected took place. This transfiguration of Jesus has first of all a meaning for himself. Jesus did not know everything beforehand; he was not spared doubts and anxieties. It does not seem that the Father manifested himself with abundant favors for him: Jesus served without expecting heavenly rewards. On this occasion however he received certitude concerning the end of his mission. For the apostles it is a decisive witness which will help them to believe in the Resurrection. (The letter headed Second Letter of Peter makes no mistake when it insists on this witness of God, even if done in an awkward way (2 P 1:17), because it claims to be written by Peter himself). It is a fact that many persons throughout history have been considered as prophets or even as the prophet, but none of them have pretended to have a witness from God in his favor, other than his own successes. Jesus counted on witnesses, beginning with John the Baptist. In all biblical revelation faith is supported by these witnesses. Here it is Moses, the founder of Israel, and Elijah, father of prophets, who recognize Jesus. Luke tells us that Moses and Elijah spoke to Jesus about his departure (v. 31) (in Greek this is exodus). Jesus then becomes the new Moses who will bring God's people from this world of slavery to the Promised Land. He is my Son. See the commentary on these same words in 3:22. Here, however, Jesus appears as the one for whom Moses and Elijah were waiting, the one for whom they had prepared, even if for this moment they can console him for he still carries the weakness of our human condition. See in relation to this Transfiguration of Jesus the commentary of Mk 9:1. Lk 9,46 See commentary on Mark 9:33. Mark remarks that Jesus took a child in his arms: something unusual for people of that time since children did not count, and religious teachers only urged that they be well disciplined. The model of religion seemed to be a serious man who did not laugh, did not run, did not look at people in lower positions, especially women and children. Oftentimes, such a mentality is seen in those who criticize child baptism and first communion. Jesus does not answer the apostles' question: Who is the greatest? because what matters is not to become great, but to be close to Christ. In order to receive Christ, we must welcome him in the person of the little ones. Lk 9,51 After having recalled the actions of Jesus in Galilee, Luke begins the second part of his Gospel, where he brings together words of Jesus spoken on different occasions. In order to preserve a continuity in his account, he imagines that Jesus is giving these responses while on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem where the third part of his gospel will take place. The first paragraph reminds us that between the two provinces of Galilee and Judea, there was Samaria. Its people were Samaritans, non-Jews, and the two peoples really hated each other. When Jews from Galilee were going on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, every door was closed to them throughout Samaria. It would seem that each time Jesus meets Samaritans, it is to teach us a new way of seeing those who do not share our faith. Religions have often been aggressive, at times very violent, especially those religions which see themselves as a revelation of the only God. This was already the case in the Old Testament. Jesus is not part of such fanaticism, teaching us not to confuse God's cause with ours nor with the interests of our religious community. There is absolute respect for those God leads by another road. What a contrast with the legends of the past that this account awakens in verse 54 (see 2 K 1:9). Here Jesus tells his apostles to be less impulsive: the Samaritans who refuse to welcome Jesus on this occasion are not more guilty than those who close their doors to a stranger. Why destroy this little village, if by doing this they still had to look for a place in another village? It was better to move on without delay. Lk 9,57 BREAKTHROUGHS - BECOMING FREE In contrast with Jesus' customary understanding attitude about human nature, here we see Jesus very demanding with the disciple who wants to follow him: Jesus cannot waste his time in forming those who are not ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of the Gospel. The third of these would-be disciples, perhaps, was secretly hoping that at the time of saying good-by, his family would beg him not to do such a foolish thing, and so he could remain with his good intentions: I would like to, but... The second case is different: Let the dead bury their dead. Faced with these abrupt words which we occasionally meet in the Gospel, there are two attitudes to be avoided. The first would be to take these words as a general rule, a precept addressed to everyone without nuance, the second, more frequent, would be to say: That must not be taken literally, it's an oriental way of speaking. For Jesus there is no entry into the Kingdom without an experience of liberty. First I want to bury my father (v. 59). This means perhaps that he should bury his father who has died. Most probably it means that he wanted to look after his aging father up to the time of his burial (Tb 6:15). It is difficult to think one is truly free if he had not had the opportunity to prove it by acting differently from what is understood and accepted around him. Think of Francis of Assisi begging for bread in his own town after having lived there as the son of a rich family. Leave them and proclaim the kingdom of God. When a call from Jesus reaches you, it is the complete will of God for you in this precise moment. Leave there your excuses, your duties: perhaps these would be duties only in a world of the dead. God has provided that others, perhaps his angels, will see to them.</li>

Remember that the Jews of Jesus' time were a poor people, too numerous for a fertile, but limited territory. The Roman occupants claimed a good portion of the resources, and politicians like Herod imposed heavy taxes, which were partly justified by the need to occupy the extra manpower in grandiose projects. Many people had no security in employment, as is true today in many countries, and Jesus along with his followers shared that situation. In that desolate area, Jesus felt responsible for all his brothers and sisters who became his guests (as also happens in Luke 11:5), and he acted according to faith. Every day, in those times until now, many people must have shared their last resources with someone poorer, confident that God would pay them back. Jesus, in turn, would do no less. The miracle he performed at that moment confirms the faith of many humble believers, who are perhaps not too devoted to the Church, but who often know how to risk all they have. Jesus is not concerned that this miracle awakens in them a misguided enthusiasm which will end up with a split among his followers (see Mk 6:45). Jesus had not fed them to attract them to his church, but to fulfill God's promises to the poor. Lk 9,18 This occurred near Caesarea Philippi, a famous spa located in the far north of Palestine, at the foot of Mount Hermon. Jesus had gone away from Galilee because he was not safe there. As was his custom, he sent the Twelve ahead of him to the villages he would visit, to prepare for his coming. What do people say about me? And you, what did you tell them about me when you were among them? Who did you tell them I was? Peter answers first, confident that they were not wrong in presenting their teacher as the Messiah, the One sent by God. Jesus does not deny that he is, but he forbids them to make it known from then on, because, according to the people, the Liberator had to crush his enemies. Can the apostles simply call Liberator, one who will die on a cross? By comparing this text with Mk 8:27 and Mt 16:13, we come to the following conclusion: Matthew combined in a single story two different events in which Peter was first in proclaiming his faith. The first episode is the one which Luke relates at this point. In the second, Peter recognized Jesus as the Son of God and received the promise which Matthew recalls. Perhaps this took place after the multiplication of the loaves: compare with John 6:66-69, or perhaps after the Resurrection: compare with John 21:15-17, which insists not on faith, but on the love that Jesus can see in Peter. See also Galatians 2:7-8. Lk 9,22 Why did Jesus ask his apostles the questions we have just read? the Gospel answers clearly: because the time had come for Jesus to announce his passion to them. Jesus had not only come to teach people but to open for them the door leading to the Resurrection. Since his apostles now know him to be the Savior promised to Israel, they must learn that there is no salvation if death is not conquered (1 Cor 15:25). Jesus will obtain this victory when he freely chooses the way of the cross: the Son of Man has to suffer much and be rejected by the authorities. Immediately after that, Jesus adds that we must all share in his victory over death: You must deny your self: this is the fundamental orientation of our life. We must choose between serving and being served, sacrificing ourselves for others or taking advantage of them. Or, as a well-known prayer puts it: Let me seek not so much to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love. It is in his early years that a child is helped towards this choice. In a true family he is not the center and king, with his parents as slaves, but he learns how to serve and give himself. He must accept his brothers and sisters, share with them and at times limit his own future for their good. Take up your cross each day (v. 33). Here comes the acceptance of the cross which the Lord gives to each one of us and which we do not have to choose because we find it in our destiny. We must not carry it because we are compelled to, but rather we must love it because the Lord wished it for us. In a world where it has become usual to live one's own life - and in so doing, to waste it, many difficult, even abnormal children, will cause their parents to become true followers of Jesus in bearing their cross. If you choose to save your life (v. 24). Jesus refers to the general orientation of our life. He has nothing in common with those who are only concerned about avoiding sins, while they pursue their ambitions and their desire to enjoy this life to the fullest. The mere fact of seeking to live without risks separates us from God's way. If someone feels ashamed of me (v. 26). Besides the cross given to us each day, God will ask us to witness to our faith and in that we will have to run risks, even if it is nothing more than the risk of being ridiculed by our friends and our boss. During periods of violence, can Christians remain silent, limit themselves to their spiritual reunions, give no concrete indication of what they themselves think and live? Lk 9,28 Recall the divine revelation Jesus received at the beginning of his ministry (Lk 3:21). This other divine manifestation Jesus receives at the Transfiguration is due to the beginning of a new stage: the Passion. Jesus has already been preaching for two years, but there is no hope that Israel will overcome the violence which will lead to its ruin. Even if Jesus' miracles do not convince his compatriots, Jesus will have to face the forces of evil: his sacrifice will be more effective than his words in arousing love and the spirit of sacrifice in all the people who will continue his saving work in the future. He took Peter, James and John with him: these men had a privileged place among the Twelve (Mk 1:29; 3:16; 5:37; 10:35; 13:3). Most probably the rest of the apostles only reacted very slowly. All the patience and pedagogy of Jesus did not make them grow more quickly and they were not ready to enter the cloud with him. He went up into the mountain to pray. It is quite possible that it was during a night of prayer that the event that Jesus expected took place. This transfiguration of Jesus has first of all a meaning for himself. Jesus did not know everything beforehand; he was not spared doubts and anxieties. It does not seem that the Father manifested himself with abundant favors for him: Jesus served without expecting heavenly rewards. On this occasion however he received certitude concerning the end of his mission. For the apostles it is a decisive witness which will help them to believe in the Resurrection. (The letter headed Second Letter of Peter makes no mistake when it insists on this witness of God, even if done in an awkward way (2 P 1:17), because it claims to be written by Peter himself). It is a fact that many persons throughout history have been considered as prophets or even as the prophet, but none of them have pretended to have a witness from God in his favor, other than his own successes. Jesus counted on witnesses, beginning with John the Baptist. In all biblical revelation faith is supported by these witnesses. Here it is Moses, the founder of Israel, and Elijah, father of prophets, who recognize Jesus. Luke tells us that Moses and Elijah spoke to Jesus about his departure (v. 31) (in Greek this is exodus). Jesus then becomes the new Moses who will bring God's people from this world of slavery to the Promised Land. He is my Son. See the commentary on these same words in 3:22. Here, however, Jesus appears as the one for whom Moses and Elijah were waiting, the one for whom they had prepared, even if for this moment they can console him for he still carries the weakness of our human condition. See in relation to this Transfiguration of Jesus the commentary of Mk 9:1. Lk 9,46 See commentary on Mark 9:33. Mark remarks that Jesus took a child in his arms: something unusual for people of that time since children did not count, and religious teachers only urged that they be well disciplined. The model of religion seemed to be a serious man who did not laugh, did not run, did not look at people in lower positions, especially women and children. Oftentimes, such a mentality is seen in those who criticize child baptism and first communion. Jesus does not answer the apostles' question: Who is the greatest? because what matters is not to become great, but to be close to Christ. In order to receive Christ, we must welcome him in the person of the little ones. Lk 9,51 After having recalled the actions of Jesus in Galilee, Luke begins the second part of his Gospel, where he brings together words of Jesus spoken on different occasions. In order to preserve a continuity in his account, he imagines that Jesus is giving these responses while on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem where the third part of his gospel will take place. The first paragraph reminds us that between the two provinces of Galilee and Judea, there was Samaria. Its people were Samaritans, non-Jews, and the two peoples really hated each other. When Jews from Galilee were going on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, every door was closed to them throughout Samaria. It would seem that each time Jesus meets Samaritans, it is to teach us a new way of seeing those who do not share our faith. Religions have often been aggressive, at times very violent, especially those religions which see themselves as a revelation of the only God. This was already the case in the Old Testament. Jesus is not part of such fanaticism, teaching us not to confuse God's cause with ours nor with the interests of our religious community. There is absolute respect for those God leads by another road. What a contrast with the legends of the past that this account awakens in verse 54 (see 2 K 1:9). Here Jesus tells his apostles to be less impulsive: the Samaritans who refuse to welcome Jesus on this occasion are not more guilty than those who close their doors to a stranger. Why destroy this little village, if by doing this they still had to look for a place in another village? It was better to move on without delay. Lk 9,57 BREAKTHROUGHS - BECOMING FREE In contrast with Jesus' customary understanding attitude about human nature, here we see Jesus very demanding with the disciple who wants to follow him: Jesus cannot waste his time in forming those who are not ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of the Gospel. The third of these would-be disciples, perhaps, was secretly hoping that at the time of saying good-by, his family would beg him not to do such a foolish thing, and so he could remain with his good intentions: I would like to, but... The second case is different: Let the dead bury their dead. Faced with these abrupt words which we occasionally meet in the Gospel, there are two attitudes to be avoided. The first would be to take these words as a general rule, a precept addressed to everyone without nuance, the second, more frequent, would be to say: That must not be taken literally, it's an oriental way of speaking. For Jesus there is no entry into the Kingdom without an experience of liberty. First I want to bury my father (v. 59). This means perhaps that he should bury his father who has died. Most probably it means that he wanted to look after his aging father up to the time of his burial (Tb 6:15). It is difficult to think one is truly free if he had not had the opportunity to prove it by acting differently from what is understood and accepted around him. Think of Francis of Assisi begging for bread in his own town after having lived there as the son of a rich family. Leave them and proclaim the kingdom of God. When a call from Jesus reaches you, it is the complete will of God for you in this precise moment. Leave there your excuses, your duties: perhaps these would be duties only in a world of the dead. God has provided that others, perhaps his angels, will see to them.</li>

There is absolute respect for those God leads by another road. What a contrast with the legends of the past that this account awakens in verse 54 (see 2 K 1:9). Here Jesus tells his apostles to be less impulsive: the Samaritans who refuse to welcome Jesus on this occasion are not more guilty than those who close their doors to a stranger. Why destroy this little village, if by doing this they still had to look for a place in another village? It was better to move on without delay. Lk 9,57 BREAKTHROUGHS - BECOMING FREE In contrast with Jesus' customary understanding attitude about human nature, here we see Jesus very demanding with the disciple who wants to follow him: Jesus cannot waste his time in forming those who are not ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of the Gospel. The third of these would-be disciples, perhaps, was secretly hoping that at the time of saying good-by, his family would beg him not to do such a foolish thing, and so he could remain with his good intentions: I would like to, but... The second case is different: Let the dead bury their dead. Faced with these abrupt words which we occasionally meet in the Gospel, there are two attitudes to be avoided. The first would be to take these words as a general rule, a precept addressed to everyone without nuance, the second, more frequent, would be to say: That must not be taken literally, it's an oriental way of speaking. For Jesus there is no entry into the Kingdom without an experience of liberty. First I want to bury my father (v. 59). This means perhaps that he should bury his father who has died. Most probably it means that he wanted to look after his aging father up to the time of his burial (Tb 6:15). It is difficult to think one is truly free if he had not had the opportunity to prove it by acting differently from what is understood and accepted around him. Think of Francis of Assisi begging for bread in his own town after having lived there as the son of a rich family. Leave them and proclaim the kingdom of God. When a call from Jesus reaches you, it is the complete will of God for you in this precise moment. Leave there your excuses, your duties: perhaps these would be duties only in a world of the dead. God has provided that others, perhaps his angels, will see to them.</li>
<li id="annotation-5">Lk 9,12 See commentary on Mark 6:35. This multiplication of the loaves occurs in all four Gospels, which is true of very few events in the Gospel. Besides this account, another multiplication of the loaves is related in Matthew 15:32 and Mark 8:1. It is likely due to the fact that one could see in it the announcement of the eucharist as will be emphasized in the Gospel of John (ch. 6). This abundance of accounts may be due to the fact that the multiplication of bread is one of the miracles of Jesus which best shows his absolute power over the laws of nature (see commentary on Mark 8:1). Remember that the Jews of Jesus' time were a poor people, too numerous for a fertile, but limited territory. The Roman occupants claimed a good portion of the resources, and politicians like Herod imposed heavy taxes, which were partly justified by the need to occupy the extra manpower in grandiose projects. Many people had no security in employment, as is true today in many countries, and Jesus along with his followers shared that situation. In that desolate area, Jesus felt responsible for all his brothers and sisters who became his guests (as also happens in Luke 11:5), and he acted according to faith. Every day, in those times until now, many people must have shared their last resources with someone poorer, confident that God would pay them back. Jesus, in turn, would do no less. The miracle he performed at that moment confirms the faith of many humble believers, who are perhaps not too devoted to the Church, but who often know how to risk all they have. Jesus is not concerned that this miracle awakens in them a misguided enthusiasm which will end up with a split among his followers (see Mk 6:45). Jesus had not fed them to attract them to his church, but to fulfill God's promises to the poor. Lk 9,18 This occurred near Caesarea Philippi, a famous spa located in the far north of Palestine, at the foot of Mount Hermon. Jesus had gone away from Galilee because he was not safe there. As was his custom, he sent the Twelve ahead of him to the villages he would visit, to prepare for his coming. What do people say about me? And you, what did you tell them about me when you were among them? Who did you tell them I was? Peter answers first, confident that they were not wrong in presenting their teacher as the Messiah, the One sent by God. Jesus does not deny that he is, but he forbids them to make it known from then on, because, according to the people, the Liberator had to crush his enemies. Can the apostles simply call Liberator, one who will die on a cross? By comparing this text with Mk 8:27 and Mt 16:13, we come to the following conclusion: Matthew combined in a single story two different events in which Peter was first in proclaiming his faith. The first episode is the one which Luke relates at this point. In the second, Peter recognized Jesus as the Son of God and received the promise which Matthew recalls. Perhaps this took place after the multiplication of the loaves: compare with John 6:66-69, or perhaps after the Resurrection: compare with John 21:15-17, which insists not on faith, but on the love that Jesus can see in Peter. See also Galatians 2:7-8. Lk 9,22 Why did Jesus ask his apostles the questions we have just read? the Gospel answers clearly: because the time had come for Jesus to announce his passion to them. Jesus had not only come to teach people but to open for them the door leading to the Resurrection. Since his apostles now know him to be the Savior promised to Israel, they must learn that there is no salvation if death is not conquered (1 Cor 15:25). Jesus will obtain this victory when he freely chooses the way of the cross: the Son of Man has to suffer much and be rejected by the authorities. Immediately after that, Jesus adds that we must all share in his victory over death: You must deny your self: this is the fundamental orientation of our life. We must choose between serving and being served, sacrificing ourselves for others or taking advantage of them. Or, as a well-known prayer puts it: Let me seek not so much to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love. It is in his early years that a child is helped towards this choice. In a true family he is not the center and king, with his parents as slaves, but he learns how to serve and give himself. He must accept his brothers and sisters, share with them and at times limit his own future for their good. Take up your cross each day (v. 33). Here comes the acceptance of the cross which the Lord gives to each one of us and which we do not have to choose because we find it in our destiny. We must not carry it because we are compelled to, but rather we must love it because the Lord wished it for us. In a world where it has become usual to live one's own life - and in so doing, to waste it, many difficult, even abnormal children, will cause their parents to become true followers of Jesus in bearing their cross. If you choose to save your life (v. 24). Jesus refers to the general orientation of our life. He has nothing in common with those who are only concerned about avoiding sins, while they pursue their ambitions and their desire to enjoy this life to the fullest. The mere fact of seeking to live without risks separates us from God's way. If someone feels ashamed of me (v. 26). Besides the cross given to us each day, God will ask us to witness to our faith and in that we will have to run risks, even if it is nothing more than the risk of being ridiculed by our friends and our boss. During periods of violence, can Christians remain silent, limit themselves to their spiritual reunions, give no concrete indication of what they themselves think and live? Lk 9,28 Recall the divine revelation Jesus received at the beginning of his ministry (Lk 3:21). This other divine manifestation Jesus receives at the Transfiguration is due to the beginning of a new stage: the Passion. Jesus has already been preaching for two years, but there is no hope that Israel will overcome the violence which will lead to its ruin. Even if Jesus' miracles do not convince his compatriots, Jesus will have to face the forces of evil: his sacrifice will be more effective than his words in arousing love and the spirit of sacrifice in all the people who will continue his saving work in the future. He took Peter, James and John with him: these men had a privileged place among the Twelve (Mk 1:29; 3:16; 5:37; 10:35; 13:3). Most probably the rest of the apostles only reacted very slowly. All the patience and pedagogy of Jesus did not make them grow more quickly and they were not ready to enter the cloud with him. He went up into the mountain to pray. It is quite possible that it was during a night of prayer that the event that Jesus expected took place. This transfiguration of Jesus has first of all a meaning for himself. Jesus did not know everything beforehand; he was not spared doubts and anxieties. It does not seem that the Father manifested himself with abundant favors for him: Jesus served without expecting heavenly rewards. On this occasion however he received certitude concerning the end of his mission. For the apostles it is a decisive witness which will help them to believe in the Resurrection. (The letter headed Second Letter of Peter makes no mistake when it insists on this witness of God, even if done in an awkward way (2 P 1:17), because it claims to be written by Peter himself). It is a fact that many persons throughout history have been considered as prophets or even as the prophet, but none of them have pretended to have a witness from God in his favor, other than his own successes. Jesus counted on witnesses, beginning with John the Baptist. In all biblical revelation faith is supported by these witnesses. Here it is Moses, the founder of Israel, and Elijah, father of prophets, who recognize Jesus. Luke tells us that Moses and Elijah spoke to Jesus about his departure (v. 31) (in Greek this is exodus). Jesus then becomes the new Moses who will bring God's people from this world of slavery to the Promised Land. He is my Son. See the commentary on these same words in 3:22. Here, however, Jesus appears as the one for whom Moses and Elijah were waiting, the one for whom they had prepared, even if for this moment they can console him for he still carries the weakness of our human condition. See in relation to this Transfiguration of Jesus the commentary of Mk 9:1. Lk 9,46 See commentary on Mark 9:33. Mark remarks that Jesus took a child in his arms: something unusual for people of that time since children did not count, and religious teachers only urged that they be well disciplined. The model of religion seemed to be a serious man who did not laugh, did not run, did not look at people in lower positions, especially women and children. Oftentimes, such a mentality is seen in those who criticize child baptism and first communion. Jesus does not answer the apostles' question: Who is the greatest? because what matters is not to become great, but to be close to Christ. In order to receive Christ, we must welcome him in the person of the little ones. Lk 9,51 After having recalled the actions of Jesus in Galilee, Luke begins the second part of his Gospel, where he brings together words of Jesus spoken on different occasions. In order to preserve a continuity in his account, he imagines that Jesus is giving these responses while on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem where the third part of his gospel will take place. The first paragraph reminds us that between the two provinces of Galilee and Judea, there was Samaria. Its people were Samaritans, non-Jews, and the two peoples really hated each other. When Jews from Galilee were going on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, every door was closed to them throughout Samaria. It would seem that each time Jesus meets Samaritans, it is to teach us a new way of seeing those who do not share our faith. Religions have often been aggressive, at times very violent, especially those religions which see themselves as a revelation of the only God. This was already the case in the Old Testament. Jesus is not part of such fanaticism, teaching us not to confuse God's cause with ours nor with the interests of our religious community.

(The letter headed Second Letter of Peter makes no mistake when it insists on this witness of God, even if done in an awkward way (2 P 1:17), because it claims to be written by Peter himself). It is a fact that many persons throughout history have been considered as prophets or even as the prophet, but none of them have pretended to have a witness from God in his favor, other than his own successes. Jesus counted on witnesses, beginning with John the Baptist. In all biblical revelation faith is supported by these witnesses. Here it is Moses, the founder of Israel, and Elijah, father of prophets, who recognize Jesus. Luke tells us that Moses and Elijah spoke to Jesus about his departure (v. 31) (in Greek this is exodus). Jesus then becomes the new Moses who will bring God's people from this world of slavery to the Promised Land. He is my Son. See the commentary on these same words in 3:22. Here, however, Jesus appears as the one for whom Moses and Elijah were waiting, the one for whom they had prepared, even if for this moment they can console him for he still carries the weakness of our human condition. See in relation to this Transfiguration of Jesus the commentary of Mk 9:1. Lk 9,46 See commentary on Mark 9:33. Mark remarks that Jesus took a child in his arms: something unusual for people of that time since children did not count, and religious teachers only urged that they be well disciplined. The model of religion seemed to be a serious man who did not laugh, did not run, did not look at people in lower positions, especially women and children. Oftentimes, such a mentality is seen in those who criticize child baptism and first communion. Jesus does not answer the apostles' question: Who is the greatest? because what matters is not to become great, but to be close to Christ. In order to receive Christ, we must welcome him in the person of the little ones. Lk 9,51 After having recalled the actions of Jesus in Galilee, Luke begins the second part of his Gospel, where he brings together words of Jesus spoken on different occasions. In order to preserve a continuity in his account, he imagines that Jesus is giving these responses while on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem where the third part of his gospel will take place. The first paragraph reminds us that between the two provinces of Galilee and Judea, there was Samaria. Its people were Samaritans, non-Jews, and the two peoples really hated each other. When Jews from Galilee were going on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, every door was closed to them throughout Samaria. It would seem that each time Jesus meets Samaritans, it is to teach us a new way of seeing those who do not share our faith. Religions have often been aggressive, at times very violent, especially those religions which see themselves as a revelation of the only God. This was already the case in the Old Testament. Jesus is not part of such fanaticism, teaching us not to confuse God's cause with ours nor with the interests of our religious community. There is absolute respect for those God leads by another road. What a contrast with the legends of the past that this account awakens in verse 54 (see 2 K 1:9). Here Jesus tells his apostles to be less impulsive: the Samaritans who refuse to welcome Jesus on this occasion are not more guilty than those who close their doors to a stranger. Why destroy this little village, if by doing this they still had to look for a place in another village? It was better to move on without delay. Lk 9,57 BREAKTHROUGHS - BECOMING FREE In contrast with Jesus' customary understanding attitude about human nature, here we see Jesus very demanding with the disciple who wants to follow him: Jesus cannot waste his time in forming those who are not ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of the Gospel. The third of these would-be disciples, perhaps, was secretly hoping that at the time of saying good-by, his family would beg him not to do such a foolish thing, and so he could remain with his good intentions: I would like to, but... The second case is different: Let the dead bury their dead. Faced with these abrupt words which we occasionally meet in the Gospel, there are two attitudes to be avoided. The first would be to take these words as a general rule, a precept addressed to everyone without nuance, the second, more frequent, would be to say: That must not be taken literally, it's an oriental way of speaking. For Jesus there is no entry into the Kingdom without an experience of liberty. First I want to bury my father (v. 59). This means perhaps that he should bury his father who has died. Most probably it means that he wanted to look after his aging father up to the time of his burial (Tb 6:15). It is difficult to think one is truly free if he had not had the opportunity to prove it by acting differently from what is understood and accepted around him. Think of Francis of Assisi begging for bread in his own town after having lived there as the son of a rich family. Leave them and proclaim the kingdom of God. When a call from Jesus reaches you, it is the complete will of God for you in this precise moment. Leave there your excuses, your duties: perhaps these would be duties only in a world of the dead. God has provided that others, perhaps his angels, will see to them.</li>
