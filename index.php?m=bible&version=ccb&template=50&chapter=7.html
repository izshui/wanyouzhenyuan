                                                        <h4>Jesus goes up to Jerusalem</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>1</sup><span value="1"><a id="text-ann-1" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-1')" class="annotation"><sup> ① </sup></a>After this Jesus went around Galilee; he would not go about in Judea because the Jews wanted to kill him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>2</sup><span value="2">Now the Jewish feast of the Tents was at hand.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>3</sup><span value="3">So the brothers of Jesus said to him, “Don’t stay here; go instead to Judea and let your disciples see the works you are doing.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>4</sup><span value="4">Anyone who wants to be known doesn’t work secretly. Since you are able to do these things, show yourself to the world.”</span></p>
<p><sup>5</sup><span value="5">His brothers spoke like this because they didn’t believe in him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>6</sup><span value="6">Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.</span></p>
<p><sup>7</sup><span value="7">The world cannot hate you; but it hates me because I bear witness and I show that its deeds are evil.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>8</sup><span value="8">Go up to the feast! I am not going to this feast, because my time has not yet come.”</span></p>
<p><sup>9</sup><span value="9">Jesus spoke like this and remained in Galilee.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>10</sup><span value="10">But after his brothers had gone to the festival, he also went up, not publicly but in secret.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>11</sup><span value="11">The Jews were looking for him at the festival and asked, “Where is he?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>12</sup><span value="12">There was a lot of talk about him among the people. Some said, “He is a good man,” but others replied, “No, he is misleading the people.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>13</sup><span value="13">For fear of the Jews no one spoke openly about him.</span></p>
<p><sup>14</sup><span value="14">When the festival was half over, Jesus went to the Temple and began to teach.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>15</sup><span value="15">The Jews marveled and said, “How is it that he knows Scriptures when he has had no teacher?”</span></p>
<p><sup>16</sup><span value="16">And Jesus answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but it comes from the One who sent me.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>17</sup><span value="17">Anyone who does the will of God shall know whether my teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own authority.</span></p>
<p><sup>18</sup><span value="18">Those who speak on their own authority wish to gain honor for themselves. But the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is truthful and there is no reason to doubt him.”</span></p>
<p><sup>19</sup><span value="19">Moses gave you the Law, didn’t he? But none of you keep the Law. Why, then, do you want to kill me?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>20</sup><span value="20">The people replied, “You have a demon; who wants to kill you?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>21</sup><span value="21">Jesus said to them, “I performed just one deed, and you are all astounded by it.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>22</sup><span value="22">But remember the circumcision ordered by Moses – actually it was not Moses but the ancestors who began this practice. You circumcise a man even on the Sabbath,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>23</sup><span value="23">and you would break the Law if you refused to do so because of the Sabbath. How is it, then, that you are indignant with me because I healed the whole person on the Sabbath?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>24</sup><span value="24">Do not judge by appearances, but according to what is right.”</span></p>
<p><sup>25</sup><span value="25"><a id="text-ann-2" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-2')" class="annotation"><sup> ② </sup></a>Some of the people of Jerusalem said, “Is this not the man they want to kill?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>26</sup><span value="26">And here he is speaking freely, and they don’t say a word to him? Can it be that the rulers know that this is really the Christ?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>27</sup><span value="27">Yet we know where this man comes from; but when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.”</span></p>
<p><sup>28</sup><span value="28">So Jesus announced in a loud voice in the Temple court where he was teaching, “You say that you know me and know where I come from! I have not come of myself; I was sent by the One who is true, and you don’t know him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>29</sup><span value="29">I know him for I come from him and he sent me.”</span></p>
<p><sup>30</sup><span value="30">They would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him because his time had not yet come.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>31</sup><span value="31">Many people in the crowd, however, believed in him and said, “When the Christ comes, will he give more signs than this man?”</span></p>
<p><sup>32</sup><span value="32">The Pharisees heard all these rumors among the people; they and the chief priests sent officers of the temple to arrest him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>33</sup><span value="33">Jesus then said, “I shall be with you a little longer; after that I shall go to him who sent me.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>34</sup><span value="34">You will look for me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come.”</span></p>
<p><sup>35</sup><span value="35">The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go where we shall not find him? Will he go abroad to the Jews dispersed among the Greek nations and teach the Greeks also?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>36</sup><span value="36">What does he mean when he says: ‘You will look for me and not find me,’ and: ‘Where I am going you cannot come’?”</span></p>
<h4>The promise of living water</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>37</sup><span value="37"><a id="text-ann-3" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-3')" class="annotation"><sup> ③ </sup></a>On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood up and proclaimed, “Let anyone who is thirsty, come to me;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>38</sup><span value="38">and let the one who believes in me drink, for the Scripture says: Out of the believer’s heart shall flow rivers of living water.”</span></p>
<p><sup>39</sup><span value="39">Jesus was referring to the Spirit which those who believe in him were to receive; the Spirit had not yet been given because Jesus had not yet entered into his Glory.</span></p>
<h4>Dispute on the origin of Christ</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>40</sup><span value="40">Many who had been listening to these words began to say, “This is the Prophet.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>41</sup><span value="41">Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some wondered, “Would the Christ come from Galilee?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>42</sup><span value="42">Doesn’t Scripture say that the Christ is a descendant of David and from Bethlehem, the city of David?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>43</sup><span value="43">The crowd was divided over him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>44</sup><span value="44">Some wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.</span></p>
<p><sup>45</sup><span value="45">The officers of the Temple went back to the chief priests who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring him?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>46</sup><span value="46">The officers answered, “No one ever spoke like this man.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>47</sup><span value="47">The Pharisees then said, “So you, too, have been led astray!</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>48</sup><span value="48">Have any of the rulers or any of the Pharisees be lieved in him?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>49</sup><span value="49">Only these cursed people, who have no knowledge of the Law!”</span></p>
<p><sup>50</sup><span value="50">Yet one of them, Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier, spoke out,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>51</sup><span value="51">“Does our law condemn people without first hearing them and knowing the facts?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>52</sup><span value="52">They replied, “Do you, too, come from Galilee? Look it up and see for yourself that no prophet is to come from Galilee.”</span></p>
<p><sup>53</sup><span value="53">And they all went home.</span></p>
<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Jn 7,1 Jesus movespeople to question his identity. It is better to question than to belong to a group which does not question because they think they already know. The brothers of jesus were like that. Show yourself to the world (v. 4). These brothers of Jesus were the families and townspeople of Nazareth (see Mk 3: 31). These people were to enter the Church after Jesus' resurrection, and thought themselves important merely because of their former association with Jesus; but at that time they were still very far from understanding his mission. They wanted Jesus to be known for his miracles; but Jesus chose, rather, to reveal himself to those who could enter into the mystery of death which leads to glor istian faith. He consistently calls his unbelieving compatriots Jews. We would be mistaken if we thought he is designating here all the Jews. With this name of Jews he points out the religious, political and social ambiance which did not acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah. Those Jews adhered to an established social order and to a certain manner of understanding life and religion that was comon in their time. It was social and religious formalities that were important to them; they were interested in God only in the measure to which they had made him the defender of these things (Mt 23: 29). Jn 7,25 SALVATION - SEEKING THE TRUTH Who is Jesus? It is very important for us to know who Jesus is and from where he comes because, unlike the founders of other religions, he offers us the unheard of gift of sharing in God's very life. If Jesus does not come from God, of what value is this promise? We need to discover for ourselves who jesus is, because it is only in this way that we will be saved. As a person he attracts us, but his words schock us. When Jesus proclaims that the Kingdom is at hand, that we are sons and daughters of God, we think he uses figures of speech since the reality appears to be quite different. In time, with more experience and sufferring, we modify our viewpoint and discover that the world and people are just as he describes them. Whe then acknowledge him as Savior. In another way, we are saved because we have acquired the capacity to see things as God does. Hence, when we wish to help others arrive at faith, it is better at times to refrain from discussions about religion. They must first enter into themselves to discover the wells pring of life. One cannot advance in the Knowledge of Christ without advancing in knowledge of oneself. We know where this man comes from (v. 27). So these Jews thought they knew who God was and what his plans were; but, in reality, they interpreted everything according to their own views and remained closed to the Truth. Standing before them, Jesus claimed to be the Envoy of God. In speaking like this he was not looking for a title to become credible, but wanted to emphasize his total dependence on the Father and his intimate knowledge of him. You will look for me and you will not find me (v. 34). This is the same warning God gave through earlier prophets (Jer 13:16). Once again, Jesus applies to himself scriptural words and prerogatives reserved for God. Jn 7,37 THE COMMUNICATION OF THE SPIRIT Spirit had not yet been given. In Wisdom 1:7, however, we read, the Spirit of God fills the universe. Actually God never ceased communicating himself. His Spirit enters into a person's spirit whom he awakens, animates and impels. At all times he has been active in the artists, thinkers and heroes, and is also present in the spirit of people of upright heart. The Spirit in not poured out like water. The Spirit of God becomes one with the spirit of the one who receives him. As long as we do not know God in truth, the Spirit comes over us, as occurred with the liberators of Israel, who did not necessarily become better for having been an instrument of God (Jdg 11:29). Only after Jesus had entered into his Glory could he give his Spirit to those who would be united with him. Spirit had not been given. Many manuscripts read: There was no Spirit. In fact the meaning is the same. In this second way of speaking spirit referes to the manifold communications of God's Spirit. This ambiguity sounds strange to believers, who consider the spirit to be a divine person. Of course, the Spirit is as much person and as much God as the Father and the Son are, but the Spirit's manner of being God and person and One is not the same. The Spirit is communication of God dispensed to all creatures through all times. He is somehow able to distribute himself, dwelling in each creature with different gifts; then he brings them back to unity in God. Because of this, Scripture sometimes says: the Spirit, at other times: spirit (Lk 1:15; Acts 6:3), or even: the spirits (Rev 1:4; 3:1). Out of him shall flow rivers of living water. Compare 4:10. Bread and water: the Body of Christ and the gift of the Holy Spirit. In 7:38 we read: Out of him shall flow rivers of living water.</li>
