                                                        <h4>Paul in Ephesus</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>1</sup><span value="1"><a id="text-ann-1" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-1')" class="annotation"><sup> ① </sup></a>While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the interior of the country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>2</sup><span value="2">whom he asked, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became believers?” They answered, “We have not even heard that anyone may receive the Holy Spirit.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>3</sup><span value="3">Paul then asked, “What kind of baptism have you received?” And they answered, “The baptism of John.”</span></p>
<p><sup>4</sup><span value="4">Paul then explained, “John’s baptism was for conversion, but he himself said they should believe in the one who was to come, and that one is Jesus.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>5</sup><span value="5">Upon hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>6</sup><span value="6">Then Paul laid his hands on them and the Holy Spirit came down upon them; and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>7</sup><span value="7">There were about twelve of them in all.</span></p>
<p><sup>8</sup><span value="8">Paul went into the synagogue and for three months he preached and discussed there boldly, trying to convince them about the Kingdom of God.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>9</sup><span value="9">Some of them, instead of believing, grew obstinate and criticized the Way publicly. So Paul departed from them and took the disciples with him. He taught daily in the lecture hall of a certain Tyrannus.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>10</sup><span value="10">He did this for two years, so that all those who lived in the province of Asia, both Jews and non-Jews, heard the word of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><sup>11</sup><span value="11"><a id="text-ann-2" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-2')" class="annotation"><sup> ② </sup></a>God did extraordinary deeds of power through the hands of Paul.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>12</sup><span value="12">Even handkerchiefs or cloths that had touched his skin were laid upon the sick and their illnesses were cured, and evil spirits also departed from them.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>13</sup><span value="13">Some Jews who traveled around driving out evil spirits, also tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those possessed by evil spirits, saying, “I command you by this Jesus whom Paul preaches.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>14</sup><span value="14">Among them were the seven sons of a Jewish priest named Sceva.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>15</sup><span value="15">But one day, when they entered a house and dared to do this, the evil spirit said to them, “Jesus I recognize and Paul I know; but who are you?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>16</sup><span value="16">Then the man with the evil spirit sprang at them and overpowered first one and then another. And he handled them so violently that they fled from that house naked and mauled.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>17</sup><span value="17">This became known to all the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus; all of them were very impressed and the name of the Lord Jesus came to be held in great honor.</span></p>
<p><sup>18</sup><span value="18">Many of those who had become believers came forward and openly acknowledged their former practices.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>19</sup><span value="19">Many who had practiced magic arts collected their books and burned them in front of everyone. When the value of these was assessed, it came to fifty thousand silver coins.</span></p>
<p><sup>20</sup><span value="20">In this way, the word of the Lord spread widely and with power.</span></p>
<h4>The silversmiths’ riot</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>21</sup><span value="21"><a id="text-ann-3" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-3')" class="annotation"><sup> ③ </sup></a>When all these events were completed, Paul, led by the Holy Spirit, decided to travel through Macedonia and Achaia again and then go on to Jerusalem. And he said, “After I have been there, I must visit Rome also.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>22</sup><span value="22">So he sent two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia ahead of him, while he himself stayed on for a time in Asia.</span></p>
<p><sup>23</sup><span value="23">About that time the city was deeply troubled because of the Way.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>24</sup><span value="24">It all began because of a certain silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver models of the temple of the goddess Artemis and whose business brought a great deal of profit to the workers.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>25</sup><span value="25">He called them, together with others who did similar work, and said, “Friends, you know that our prosperity depends on this work.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>26</sup><span value="26">But, as you can see and hear for yourselves, this Paul has led astray a great number of people, not only here in Ephesus, but also throughout most of the province of Asia. And he has convinced them that gods made by human hands are no gods at all.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>27</sup><span value="27">The danger grows that not only our trade will be discredited, but even that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will count for nothing. She whom Asia and all the world worships may soon be stripped of her renown.”</span></p>
<p><sup>28</sup><span value="28">On hearing this they became enraged and began shouting, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>29</sup><span value="29">The uproar spread throughout the whole city. The mob rushed to the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were Paul’s traveling companions.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>30</sup><span value="30">Paul wished to face this crowd, but the disciples would not let him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>31</sup><span value="31">Some of the officials of the Asian province also, who were friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to show himself in the theater.</span></p>
<p><sup>32</sup><span value="32">Meanwhile the whole assembly was in an uproar. Some shouted one thing, and some shouted another and most of them did not know why they were there.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>33</sup><span value="33">Some of the crowd wanted a certain Alexander to speak, whom the Jews put forward. Alexander intended to make a speech of defense before the crowd,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>34</sup><span value="34">but when they recognized that he was a Jew, they chanted all together for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</span></p>
<p><sup>35</sup><span value="35">Finally the town clerk was able to calm the mob. He said, “Citizens of Ephesus, who does not know that Ephesus is keeper of the temple of the great Artemis, and of her image which fell from the sky?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>36</sup><span value="36">Since these things are undeniable, you must calm yourselves and do nothing rash.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>37</sup><span value="37">These men whom you brought here are not temple-robbers nor have they spoken ill of our goddess.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>38</sup><span value="38">If Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen want to bring charges against anyone, the courts are open and there are officials. Let them bring charges against each other.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>39</sup><span value="39">If there is anything further that needs to be investigated, let it be done in the lawful assembly.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>40</sup><span value="40">For as it is today, we are in danger of being charged with rioting, since there is no valid excuse we can give for this wild demonstration.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>41</sup><span value="41">And the town clerk dismissed the assembly.</span></p>

Many Christians would be surprised today if they have never had this tangible experience of God. Let us not say that these gifts are no longer useful or that such things do not happen today. What is important, surely, is to believe and live one's faith rather than to feel it. Such an experience, however, is often the shock that gives rise to a re-blossoming of our faith: it shows us that God is near, and he is master of our inner self.

It is also possible that at the moment of receiving the water in the name of the Holy Trinity, the person baptized had to make a personal invocation in the Name of Jesus. Possibly also in early times, baptism was given in the Name of Jesus and later the Church modified the formula in order to distinguish itself from groups that believed in Jesus but without recognizing him as Son of God, born of the Father. There would be nothing to astonish us in such a change: the Church of the apostles had given the first formula; the same Church gave the second formula attributed to Jesus in Mt 28:19. Acts 19,11 Many are the signs that Jesus promised for those who would believe (Mk 16:15-18). Similar things happen today when the Church becomes missionary again. We are impressed by the cures.

It appeared, however, alongside many other religions. The Roman world was full of religious restlessness, and from Asia in particular came many doctrines, cults and teachings which claimed to free people from death. The Gospel was different from all of them since, while those doctrines were merely theories, the apostles were proclaiming a fact: a Jew named Jesus has risen and we have seen him risen.
