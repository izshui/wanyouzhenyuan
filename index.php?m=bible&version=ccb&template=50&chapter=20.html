                                                        <h4>The Lord is risen</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>1</sup><span value="1"><a id="text-ann-1" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-1')" class="annotation"><sup> ① </sup></a>Now, on the first day after the Sabbath, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning, while it was still dark and she saw that the stone blocking the tomb had been moved away.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>2</sup><span value="2">She ran to Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved. And she said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb and we don’t know where they have laid him.”</span></p>
<p><sup>3</sup><span value="3">Peter then set out with the other disciple to go to the tomb.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>4</sup><span value="4">They ran together but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>5</sup><span value="5">He bent down and saw the linen cloths lying flat, but he did not enter.</span></p>
<p><sup>6</sup><span value="6">Then Simon Peter came following him and entered the tomb; he, too, saw the linen cloths lying flat.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>7</sup><span value="7">The napkin, which had been around his head was not lying flat like the other linen cloths but lay rolled up in its place.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>8</sup><span value="8">Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in; he saw and believed.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>9</sup><span value="9">Scripture clearly said that he must rise from the dead, but they had not yet understood that.</span></p>
<p><sup>10</sup><span value="10">The disciples then went home again.</span></p>
<p><sup>11</sup><span value="11"><a id="text-ann-2" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-2')" class="annotation"><sup> ② </sup></a>Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she bent down to look inside;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>12</sup><span value="12">she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had been, one at the head, and the other at the feet.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>13</sup><span value="13">They said, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She answered, “Because they have taken my Lord and I don’t know where they have put him.”</span></p>
<p><sup>14</sup><span value="14">As she said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not recognize him.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>15</sup><span value="15">Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” She thought it was the gardener and answered him, “Lord, if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will go and remove him.”</span></p>
<p><sup>16</sup><span value="16">Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him, “Rabboni” – which means, Master.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>17</sup><span value="17">Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me; you see I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them: I am ascending to my Father, who is your Father, to my God, who is your God.”</span></p>
<p><sup>18</sup><span value="18">So Mary of Magdala went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord, and this is what he said to me.”</span></p>
<p><sup>19</sup><span value="19"><a id="text-ann-3" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-3')" class="annotation"><sup> ③ </sup></a>On the evening of that day, the first day after the Sabbath, the doors were locked where the disciples were, because of their fear of the Jews, but Jesus came and stood in their midst. He said to them, “Peace be with you”;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>20</sup><span value="20">then he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples kept looking at the Lord and were full of joy.</span></p>
<p><sup>21</sup><span value="21">Again Jesus said to them, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>22</sup><span value="22">After saying this he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>23</sup><span value="23">for those whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven; for those whose sins you retain, they are retained.”</span></p>
<p><sup>24</sup><span value="24">Thomas, the Twin, one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>25</sup><span value="25">The other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he replied, “Until I have seen in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.”</span></p>
<p><sup>26</sup><span value="26">Eight days later, the disciples were inside again and Thomas was with them. Despite the locked doors Jesus came and stood in their midst and said, “Peace be with you.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>27</sup><span value="27">Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and see my hands; stretch out your hand and put it into my side. Resist no longer and be a believer.”</span></p>
<p><sup>28</sup><span value="28">Thomas then said, “You are my Lord and my God.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>29</sup><span value="29">Jesus replied, “You believe because you see me, don’t you? Happy are those who have not seen and believe.”</span></p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>30</sup><span value="30">There were many other signs that Jesus gave in the presence of his disciples, but they are not recorded in this book.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>31</sup><span value="31">These are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; believe and you will have life through his Name.</span></p>
<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Jn 20,1 On the second day after the burial it appeared that Jesus was alive and had gone from the tomb. The resurrection took place on the first day of the week, which henceforth would be called the Day of the Lord, that is, Sunday. In Luke's Gospel, after Jesus' resurrection he helps his disciples revive their faith and hope. Here instead we see the believers silently contemplating the risen Lord. Christ appears to Mary, who does not recognize him. When he stands in the midst of his disciples, he has to show his wounds to prove that it is he himself, he who had died. Jesus is among them, but his appearance is that of a stranger, and his spiritually transformed body radiates the victory over sin and death. Then Peter arrived. Several texts record that Peter was both a witness to the emplty tomb and of Jesus risen from the dead (Lk 24:12 and 24:44; 1 Cor 15:5). Our faith is supported primarily by the testimony of the apostles, and expecially by the testimony of the head of the apostles. He saw the linen cloths lying flat. The linenes designate the sheet, about 4 meters long, spread under the body from the feet to the head and then, above the body, from the head to the feet; they also refer to the bands that tied the two ends of the sheet. The dead person's face was wrapped with a separate cloth, the napkin which was tied under the chin and over the head. The sheet and the bands were lying where the body had been but were flat, for the body inside them had dematerialized. The napkin, which was rolled in the other direction, stayed as it was. Jesus had not returned to life with his earthly body. This had dematerialized, so when we speak of the risen body of Jesus, we refer to something we have never experienced on earth. Those who have had dreams and visions of Jesus have only seen images of him, but have not actually seen him, except for a few of the most eminent saints. Jn 20,11 Do not cling to me, yousee I have not yet ascended to the Father (v.17). Before his death, Jesus did not disapprove of the passionate feelings and actions of Mary. Now this familiar gesture to take possession of her loved Master is no longer appropriate. He is now the Risen One, and though he lets himself be seen by his disciples for a few days, he is in the glory of the Father. His disciples must relinquish the physical presence of Jesus with which they felt so much at ease. From now on the followers or the brothers and lovers of Jesus will embrace him in a secret and marvelous way, when they are given gifts of prayer and faith. It is then that the contemplative spirit, who is represented by Mary, may enjoy the whole of Christ (see Song 3:4). I have not yet ascended to the Father. Jesus is revealing the great desire which filled his life. He came from God and must return to the Father. This is the greatest love in the world. All the love that jesus has for us is but a manifestation of that other love, because God the Father is the fountain and the goal of all love. See the commentary on Mattew 19:16 in this regard. It is not chance that the word Lord is again repeated seven times, the last time by Thomas: you are my Lord and my God. This expresses the faith of the Church. Let us remark that the persons concerned in this event did in fact call Jesus, the Master. However, John puts on their kips the word Lord. Why? From the first days of the Church, the believers had to find words to express their faith in Jesus, Son of God. Being the son, he was not the same person as God, but he was one with him. How to express this divine condition? In the Bible two names were given to God: God and Yahweh. At that time the Jews no longer pronounced the name of Yahweh and instead said: the Lord. Moreover, in the Greek Bible used by the apostles and the Church, Yahweh was also translated as the Lord. So the apostles decided very soon to retain the term God when speaking of God the Father, and to call Jesus the Lord, by this affirming that he was not inferior to the Father. The risen Jesus' apparitions to his disciples, besides fostering their hope and making them qualified withnesses of his resurrection, were necessary for their spiritual formation. The disciples had to learn to recognize Jesus no longer through their senses but through faith. Likewise, we have to learn to recognize and follow Jesus in the dim light of faith, in desolation as well as in consolation, thus we too will be among those whom Jesus blesses: Happy are those who believe without seeing me (v.29). Jn 20,19 Just as in the first creaation God infused life into Adam, so, too, Jesus' breath communicates life to the new spiritual creation. Christ who died to take away the sin of the world, now leaves to his own the power to forgive. Thus the hope of the biblical people has been realized. God led them in such a way that they felt the universal presence of sin, and so thy offered animaals in the Temple uniniterruptedly to apease God. That river of blood failed to destroy sin, and the priests themselves offered sacrifices for their own sins before praying to God for the others. Ceremonies and rites had no power to purify the heart or to give the Holy Spirit. Now, in the person of Jesus risen from the dead, a new world has begun. Although humanity may continue to sin, already the first of its sons and daughters, the eldest brother of them all is sharing fully the holy life of God. Those who strive for the spiritual life, suffer above all from a keen awareness of the universal presence of sin. They grieve deeply at not yet having attained total liberation from sin. Hence they recognize the forgiveness of sin as the greatest gift given to the Church. The capacity to forgive is the only prower able to release the great tensions within humankind. Although it does not easily conquer hearts, it is an invaluable secret and the Church should consider it as its own particular treasure. One who does not know how to forgive does not know how to love. On making us aware of sin and purifying us from it, the Church helps us demonstrate a more authentic love for the neighbor.</li>
