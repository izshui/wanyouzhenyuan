<br/>
<p><sup>1</sup><span value="1"><a id="text-ann-1" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-1')" class="annotation"><sup> ① </sup></a>In the first part of my work, Theophilus, I wrote of all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>2</sup><span value="2">until the day when he ascended to heaven. But first he had instructed through the Holy Spirit the apostles he had chosen.</span></p>
<p><sup>3</sup><span value="3">After his passion, he presented himself to them, giving many signs that he was alive; over a period of forty days he appeared to them and taught them concerning the kingdom of God.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>4</sup><span value="4">Once when he had been eating with them, he told them, “Do not leave Jerusalem but wait for the fulfillment of the Father’s promise about which I have spoken to you:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>5</sup><span value="5">John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit within a few days.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>6</sup><span value="6">When they had come together, they asked him, “Is it now that you will restore the Kingdom of Israel?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>7</sup><span value="7">And he answered, “It is not for you to know the time and the steps that the Father has fixed by his own authority.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>8</sup><span value="8">But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Sama ria, even to the ends of the earth.”</span></p>
<p><sup>9</sup><span value="9">After Jesus said this, he was taken up before their eyes and a cloud hid him from their sight.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>10</sup><span value="10">While they were still looking up to heaven where he went, suddenly, two men dressed in white stood beside them</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>11</sup><span value="11">and said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking up at the sky? This Jesus who has been taken from you into heaven, will return in the same way as you have seen him go there.”</span></p>
<h4>The disciples await the Holy Spirit</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>12</sup><span value="12"><a id="text-ann-2" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-2')" class="annotation"><sup> ② </sup></a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount called Olives, which is a fifteen-minute walk away.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>13</sup><span value="13">On entering the city they went to the room upstairs where they were staying. Present there were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, son of Alpheus; Simon the Zealot and Judas son of James.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>14</sup><span value="14">All of these together gave themselves to constant prayer. With them were some women and also Mary, the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</span></p>
<h4>Matthias elected</h4>
<br/>
<p><sup>15</sup><span value="15"><a id="text-ann-3" href="javascript:jumpTo('#annotation-3')" class="annotation"><sup> ③ </sup></a>It was during this time that Peter stood up in the midst of the community – about one hundred and twenty in all –</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>16</sup><span value="16">and he said, “Brothers, it was necessary that the Scriptures referring to Judas be fulfilled. The Holy Spirit had spoken through David about the one who would lead the crowd coming to arrest Jesus.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>17</sup><span value="17">He was one of our number and had been called to share our common ministry.</span></p>
<p><sup>18</sup><span value="18">(We know that he bought a field with the reward of his sin; yet he threw himself headlong to his death, his body burst open and all his bowels spilled out.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>19</sup><span value="19">This event became known to all the people living in Jerusalem and they named that field Akeldama in their own language, which means Field of Blood).</span></p>
<p><sup>20</sup><span value="20">In the book of Psalms it is written:Let his house become deserted and may no one live in it. But it is also written: May another take his office.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>21</sup><span value="21">Therefore we must choose someone from among those who were with us during all the time that the Lord Jesus moved about with us,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>22</sup><span value="22">beginning with John’s baptism until the day when Jesus was taken away from us. One of these has to become, with us, a witness to his resurrection.”</span></p>
<p><sup>23</sup><span value="23">Then they proposed two: Joseph, called Barsabbas, also known as Justus, and Matthias.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>24</sup><span value="24">They prayed: “You know, Lord, what is in the hearts of all. Show us, therefore, which of the two you have chosen</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>25</sup><span value="25">to replace Judas in this apostolic ministry which he deserted to go to the place he deserved.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span><sup>26</sup><span value="26">Then they drew lots between the two and the choice fell on Matthias who was added to the eleven apostles.</span></p>
<div class="annotations"><ol><li id="annotation-1">Acts 1,1 Throughout the Book of the Acts, the apostles affirm that they are witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus (2:32; 3:15; 5:32; 10:41; 13:31...). This testimony is not based on vague sentiments or doubtful visions, but on the proofs that Jesus gave to his apostles after his resurrection and which are echoed in the gospels. The reference to the forty days is important. Inspired by the number of weeks - forty - which the child spends in its mother's womb, the symbolic number forty indicates both the time of trial or growth and that of maturity: it is the time of waiting for new life. During forty days in the desert, Jesus prepared himself for his mission of Savior, during forty days the apostles will prepare themselves for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and for their mission of witness. It is in Jerusalem that the apostles will receive the baptism in the Spirit which will make them into new people. The Spirit which hovered over the waters (Gen 1:2) during the first days of creation, will descend upon them and inaugurate the new dispensation. The Church of which they will be the pillars will be first and above all the work of the Holy Spirit. It is in the Spirit that the apostles will find the strength to be witnesses of the Risen One in the very midst of the world. You will be my witnesesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, even to the ends of the earth. Luke outlines here the geographic framework of the Book of Acts (see Introduction to the Acts of the Apostles). At the same time, he demonstrates how the dynamic of the Old Testament is reversed with the death and resurrection of Jesus. From the first pages of the Book of Genesis, we know that the sky and the earth belong to God: he is their Creator and all belongs to him. Later with the call of Abraham and the journey of Moses, we discover that in this universe there is one country which is particularly blessed by God, it is the Land of Promise; when David settles in Jerusalem, this city becomes the city of David, and at the same time, the city of God. From then on the Psalmist can say: God preferred Jerusalem to all the towns of Jacob (Ps 87:2) and in this Holy City, it is on the Temple Mount that God has prepared his dwelling (1 K 8:29). Thus gradually, according as God walks side by side with his people, lighting up the way with his Word, all eyes become fixed on Jerusalem and on the Temple. Now, it is when people have destroyed the true Temple (Jn 2:19), the humanity of the Son by nailing him to the cross, that God brings forth life from death, and from then on, a new dynamic will burst forth from Jerusalem towards the other countries of the Promised Land (Judea and Samaria), and from the Promised Land to the ends of the earth. Each of the gospels in their own way, finish with the sending of the disciples. Similarly, from the first pages of the Acts, Jesus reminds his Church of the demands of mission: when the Church, or even when the smallest community ceases to be missionary, she is no longer the Church of Christ. After Jesus said this, he was taken up before their eyes (v. 9). Jesus multiplied the proofs of his resurrection for those whose vocation would be to become witnesses of the risen Christ (v. 3), but now he must let the disciples know the significance of the resurrection. In this final apparition on the day of his ascension, Jesus revealed to them the meaning of his own story: having come from the Father, he returns to the Father but he does not return alone, he brings with him a captive people (Eph 4:8) whom he snatches from the power of darkness in order to bring them into his Kingdom of Light (Col 1:13), he goes to prepare a place for us, so that where he is, we may be too (Jn 14:2-3). For the moment, the disciples are still in this world, where they must bear witness to the new reality of the kingdom of God inaugurated by Jesus: a Kingdom which is not like the earthly kingdoms founded on power and money (Lk 22:25-26), but a Kingdom of love, of justice, of peace. This Kingdom is not to be found in the clouds, it is already in our midst (Lk 17:20-21) and it grows each time we let ourselves be guided by the Spirit of God. Acts 1,12 The apostles cannot begin such a difficult mission before they have received the Holy Spirit. They have done everything that depended on them and now can only put themselves in the hands of God and wait perseveringly in prayer for the time he has fixed. As John has done in giving us the word of Jesus to his mother, present at the foot of the cross (Jn 19:26-27), Luke here reveals to us the spiritual maternity of Mary. She is there sharing in the longing of the apostles, she is the New Eve, the new mother of all the living (Gen 3:20). Mary, mother of Jesus, played a decisive role during those days when the apostles tried to reflect together on all they had seen and learned from Jesus, in order to clarify the message they had to give to the world. Mary, only witness of the annunciation and of the private life of Jesus, helped them perceive the mystery of his divine personality. Luke does not speak about this: from now on Mary keeps herself in the background. Different from those brothers of Jesus who long for power in the Church, she is but a praying presence. From that moment the Church has a hierarchy but all those called to receive the Spirit are full members of this community or communion. Acts 1,15 Peter is acting here as head of the primitive Church. The death of Judas has left a vacancy in the college of apostles whose twelve members bring to mind the twelve sons of Jacob. Just as the Israel of old never accepted being deprived of one or many of its tribes, so too, Peter, will not permit the group of the Twelve to have one of its members amputated. Peter will find a way to allow God to make known his choice. We may be surprised today that such an important decision could have been made by casting lots. Is this not a sort of washing one's hands of the decision-making process? We must not forget that this episode is happening in a community whose religious culture welcomes signs from God. They know the qualities they would want to see in the candidates and two are eligible. Now the question is which one to choose? They pray to God to make his decision known and promise to accept the outcome. This election process, in the spirit of prayer and of abandonment to God, is it not finally as good as certain election processes, not excluding those used by the cardinals in conclave, where the real challenges to the Church have often been compromised by the dishonest voting of interested parties? It is good to focus in this passage on the conditions which Peter laid down: To have followed Jesus from John's baptism until the day when he was taken from us. The Good News begins with the preaching of John and culminates with the ascension (Acts 13:14-31). In this way Mark's is the typical gospel, Matthew and Luke have both added an introduction, the infancy narratives, while John makes use of a prologue to act as a kind of preface. For each of the evangelists, it is the resurrection accounts which dominate their gospels and give them meaning. Like on so many occasions in the Old Testament (Jacob, Samuel, David...) God again chooses the second and possibly even the more simple person: let us examine the calling card of the first: Joseph named Barsabbas, also known as Justus while it is Matthias, without any other name or nickname, who is chosen by God.</li>

She is there sharing in the longing of the apostles, she is the New Eve, the new mother of all the living (Gen 3:20). Mary, mother of Jesus, played a decisive role during those days when the apostles tried to reflect together on all they had seen and learned from Jesus, in order to clarify the message they had to give to the world. Mary, only witness of the annunciation and of the private life of Jesus, helped them perceive the mystery of his divine personality. Luke does not speak about this: from now on Mary keeps herself in the background. Different from those brothers of Jesus who long for power in the Church, she is but a praying presence. From that moment the Church has a hierarchy but all those called to receive the Spirit are full members of this community or communion. Acts 1,15 Peter is acting here as head of the primitive Church. The death of Judas has left a vacancy in the college of apostles whose twelve members bring to mind the twelve sons of Jacob. Just as the Israel of old never accepted being deprived of one or many of its tribes, so too, Peter, will not permit the group of the Twelve to have one of its members amputated. Peter will find a way to allow God to make known his choice. We may be surprised today that such an important decision could have been made by casting lots. Is this not a sort of washing one's hands of the decision-making process? We must not forget that this episode is happening in a community whose religious culture welcomes signs from God. They know the qualities they would want to see in the candidates and two are eligible. Now the question is which one to choose? They pray to God to make his decision known and promise to accept the outcome. This election process, in the spirit of prayer and of abandonment to God, is it not finally as good as certain election processes, not excluding those used by the cardinals in conclave, where the real challenges to the Church have often been compromised by the dishonest voting of interested parties? It is good to focus in this passage on the conditions which Peter laid down: To have followed Jesus from John's baptism until the day when he was taken from us. The Good News begins with the preaching of John and culminates with the ascension (Acts 13:14-31). In this way Mark's is the typical gospel, Matthew and Luke have both added an introduction, the infancy narratives, while John makes use of a prologue to act as a kind of preface. For each of the evangelists, it is the resurrection accounts which dominate their gospels and give them meaning. Like on so many occasions in the Old Testament (Jacob, Samuel, David...) God again chooses the second and possibly even the more simple person: let us examine the calling card of the first: Joseph named Barsabbas, also known as Justus while it is Matthias, without any other name or nickname, who is chosen by God.</li>
